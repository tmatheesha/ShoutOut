"Good thoughts. Instead of deferring to the one that was asked first, would it make more sense to migrate some of the Sci Fi questions if they fit better on Movies (according to criteria 2-4)? Has that ever been done before? (Migrating questions after a new site is created and is a better fit for questions asked elsewhere)"
"As regards the lightsaber point, I think any discussion of the in-universe workings of a lightsaber should be on SciFi, but a discussion of how they work in a film, i.e., on-sceen, would probably belong on Movies."
"My two cents: The ending of Inception question is actually more suited to Movies, and should be migrated. Same goes for the Star Wars question, albeit to a lesser extent. (It also seems rather non-constructive/subjective, but thats a different topic.)"
"I loved Inception, but Im not sure any single movie should be worthy of its own tag.  How do we distinguish between worthy and unworthy movies?"
I think of it as a rather related topic--movies based on a book could potentially fit into Movies and then Literature and/or SciFi or others depending on its genre. I dont actually know that much about meta-decisions and how the different SEs are handled so Im just guessing really.
"There are also non-movie non-TV video productions that we might want to consider.  Documentaries, shorts, etc."
"I dont know the first two mentioned, but Chris Markers La Jet?e for sure is a movie. To the original question: another grey zone are tv-movies in multiple parts (mini-series), I think for example about Wild Palms."
Mnementh: I think thats fair.  Although right now our FAQ hasnt even been written yet (its just a very stripped-down boiler plate)
"Flimzy, moving/closing a question is a bad experience for the user who was otherwise asking it correctly and had no reasonable way to know that he was doing it wrong.  Im not suggesting we have multiple duplicate questions - Im suggesting we reduce frequency duplicate questions by recognizing there are numerous overlapping sites on the StackExchange network and taking that into account in the workflow."
"I dont think merging/closing a question _is_ a bad experience. In fact, its a _good_ experience, because it means the one asking gets an answer immediately, instead of waiting. SE is about providing expert quality answers to questions. If a person asks a duplicate question, the fastest way to help them is to point them to _already existing_ expert answers. If someone takes offense at this, theyre using SE incorrectly. Remember: SE and the entire voting system is about _questions and answers_. Closing a question is _in no way_ a reflection of the one asking."
Its a *better* experience to be told by the system that your question has already been posted on an overlapping site so you get your answer *immediately*.  Isnt that the whole point of Questions similar to this?  To avoid duplicate content and help people get answers faster?  It makes sense for overlapping sites to be included in these searches.
"Alexei  Of Course they are movies, Got the point"
"Thank you for pointing that out. Im using SE-sites for some ears now, and I didnt know that discussion (its somewhat new, from the start of this year). Clearly that is a general rule for SE-sites, but also it is not communicated enough. I think that should be added to FAQ, as it is a general rule to the FAQ-template."
Well I guess asking questions about any movie of any language is allowed
"sure but if we disallow these kinds of questions, I for one will not be interested in being a member of this site. Its the collective knowledge of people that interests me - peoples ability to turn me on to things that I havent seen or heard about."
"Wow, this is spot on. I put together an answer, but you said it so much clearer than I ever did. I may just cite this post the next time this issue comes up."
"I know the problems with CW, but I think it is OK to use it for big-list questions where there is a right answer but many answers. Too subjective list questions are bad mainly because of being too subjective, but good list questions are possible and they can be very helpful for users."
Another good reason to vote early and often is that it will allow new users to reach quickly the voting privilege and grow the community. And also vote up interesting comments as well. Many new users do not realize that you can do it.
"Matthew Thanks for the clarification. I was worried about tags getting too specific, as Im also used to the somewhat modular tagging system we use in Gaming. "
"Theres a huge overlap in the techniques, technology, etc.  - But little overlap in audience. And there is a huge overlap in technique and technology with playing music as well."
"Matthew: Yes, exactly. The point is that the audiences for Music recording and Video production do not overlap, but that the audiences for Music recording and Music performance *do* overlap. And therefore Music recording should be a part of *this* site and not the Video production site."
"Lennart Couldnt you also say that if the questions were here, they should be tagged `audio-production` when relevant so that interested AVP users could find it?  I think that would be just as natural as tagging `music` on the other site.  Its not a meta tag either, so Im not sure I buy the idea than an AVP user asking about recording music wouldnt tag with `music` or something else useful."
"Matthew: Yes, you could say that. And I *did* say that. Except that the natural tag would be recording, which I mentioned above. Hence, users interested in recording would find it quite easily."
"So I think we just have a fundamental difference of opinion, which is fine.  Would you mind editing your question to be neutral, and posting your opinion as an answer?  That way we can get better community feedback about which option is preferred and why."
"Good idea, done! Too bad I didnt do it from the start, now it will be skewed. Ah well."
Specific tags are good for instruments - the difference between a [baroque-flute] and [flute] are pretty significant 
"Yep. I think the generally encouraged idea is to use `baroque-flute` if the question is specifically about that type of flute, and not just if you happen to be using a baroque flute and are asking a general question."
"Matthew: You forget peoples tendency to follow the flow. 7 vs -1? Who is going to look like a fool and vote for -1? But anyway, it doesnt need to be decided now. guitars.SE is likely to be merged here too, but not until the end of the beta period, and the same would go for the migration of recording questions, of course."

"History is on topic sure. And as such maybe this also is on topic. But is it even possible to answer? Sounds very subjective to me. Possibly there is some objective similarities in this case, but more often than not it wont be, I suspect (but what do I know?)"
I have some musical friends who might be interested in contributing to the private Beta?  Can I invite them or do they have to wait until the public Beta?
I joined this SE because I see the death of guitars.SE as practically inevitable.
Could a question that regards to music software or sequencers be treated as appropriate?
"Synthesizers and sequencers are just a type of musical instruments, and is without a doubt a form of musical &quot;practice &amp;amp; performance, composition, technique, theory, and history."
"My answer: Yes. A question about notation software is not about music per se, but about one of the tools. But an amplifier or a guitar pedal is also a tool. And in fact, the guitar itself is just a tool used to make music.So excluding questions about how to use notational software seems arbitrary to me."
"For non-English speakers, technical terms about music are sometimes difficult to find. Can you list available glossaries please? I will start with the musical notation glossary from LilyPond."
"As I m sure we all know, health is an important part of being a musician. Pianists tend to be especially concerned with their hands, and singers tend to be concerned about everything located above the diaphragm."
"I would not redirect a user who asks an on-topic question to go to a different site.  Remember that it s OK to duplicate content; if it s an exact duplicate, then one will simply be closed and point to the other when the sites are merged.  The answers can even be moved from one question to the other if the mods think it is warranted. As for answering the question, I would go ahead.  If the answer from Guitars is good, copy it and reference it.  Make your answer Community Wiki if you don t feel comfortable receiving rep for an answer."
"Moderators have the ability to merge questions.  I think those questions should be flagged here in meta after the merge occurs, and the mods can take appropriate action on a question-by-question basis."
"Having been a musician all my life I know what drives musicians - love of the art and improving their musicianship. When I saw this site yesterday (just joined) I immediately thought the site was terrific but the name wasn t much of a grabber. I ll throw my two cents in by suggesting Being A Better Musician I believe this name has the following advantages:It appeals to working musicians and aspiring musicians alike in any musical field playing any instrument. Even for absolute beginners, I m sure they would be dying to peek at it to learn and see what the issues are.The name has  drawing in the audience with a curious and friendly invitation. It justifies discussion topics in all areas of music - performance, technique, theory, hardware, instrumentation, composition, computer apps, and so on. It implies everything that more mundane titles would imply, like Music, or Musicianship, or the original title, but it adds action to the title - the ultimate action for musicians. It puts the most positive focus there is on the discussions.It would lend itself well to consolidating other musical sites if that ever arises.What s in a name? In the marketing world... everything"
I think SongTrellis provides a very valuable third-party service for this. See the answer to is-there-some-sort-of-mark-up-for-music-notation Is there some sort of mark-up for music notation where is offered and explained.
"When you see a question that doesn t have an answer or that deserves more thorough answers, try to publicize it on other sites where it may draw attention. For instance via a facebook group on music. There is a button below every question and answer for that very purpose"
"Throughout the beta, we need members from the site whose focus is to engage the community, both in community-building issues and site management. That s why we select a few members from each community to act as temporary, provisional Moderators. You can read about the program here: Moderators Pro TemporeI am pleased to announce that these members have stepped up and generously volunteered their time to help us assure that each community?s issues are properly addressed. NReilingh We want to make this site a huge success, and these members are great examples of exactly the type of people we need to make this site succeed. Please welcome them for the hard work and time they contribute.Did I overlook anyone?;Almost certainly. There are members who are actively involved and very deserving of recognition. My failure to account for everyone this early on is in a slight against them. Ideally, Moderators are elected by the community and that s why you ll have your elections after your site makes it through graduation.Most of all, be respectful and understanding of the Moderators Pro Tem. Members of your community are volunteering their time and learning on the job. It?s a learning experience for everyone. "
"In music, some good learning books can be hard to find, and when searching for this in Google or shopping sites, it can be hard to find exactly what you are after.  I agree that general shopping lists for nice to know stuff and subjective your favorite  should be off-topic. But questions about how to find good learning books for conducting, playing harmonica, etc. would be helpful as you can then search for specific titles when you go shopping ).  These question should however include some details about your current knowledge level, what music style you r interested in etc."
"I would like to ask questions about when to use certain Chord progressions in music, but I feel that it might be too subjective. It really can t give a definitive answer.I feel though that it leaves a lot of ground untouched. I m sure there are a lot of opinions and knowledge on the subject that could help a composer like myself write music.Shouldn t we allow questions like these to be asked on the site? They may be subjective, but music is a subjective topic. (minus the theory) It just feels as though a lot of knowledge is passing us by. I m sure it would attract more people to the site as well."
"It is definitely useful to keep information that it came from Guitars.SE, but the link should be removed (not fixed, as it would point to the same question you re currently  looking at). Also it would be good to have a note that the original site does not longer exist, and all guitar related questions should be asked here at music. "
"It is now possible to embed YouTube (audio/video) and SoundCloud (audio) clips in posts here.Upload your audio to the respective site.When composing your post, paste the URL to the uploaded audio in the body, on a line by itself,   like so:I m trying to reproduce this performance...I can t quite capture this sound...After you save the post, it will be rendered with an embedded player of the appropriate type;You can see some examples of this in action at How important is it to have an EQ pedal in your chain?How do I play this tab of No More Sorrow Head on over to the main site"

Therefore, if we can reach people who have big mouths, more people will know who we are and why we re awesome.I d like to compile a list of music bloggers and journalists that you all think would be good to expose to this site.This list is not a who can I spam with press releases?type list. Ideally, these people would explore the site, use it a little, and if they like us, do some sort of review / publicity. And hopefully continue to be active users; we re looking for people who are experts in this area AND have some sort of following / klout in the community.I encourage each of you to promote the site whenever you can, to whomever you can - I will not provide a form letter because we at Stack Exchange believe in honest-to-goodness one-on-one interaction.;Although someone posted form letter over on Cooking.SE a long time ago.I think it would be great to have all these bloggers and journalists listed in one place that can be curated collectively and   continually.So...who do you think are good people to contact to help spread the word about music.SE and attract new users?"
"Already I am seeing tags used for individual movies - Inception, Tree-of-life, Star Wars.Should we be encouraging tagging on individual movies, or will that get out of hand with each movie getting its own tag.  I can see the argument for series of movies - Star Wars, James Bond - but I am unsure about the use of tags for individual movies. "
"I can t find where I ve read about this before, but I m quite sure that little-used tags are automatically removed by the system after some time.  So to some extent, this will be a self-correcting problem.  Tags for movies of low popularity will, after a time, not clutter our tag collection. "
"I see a lot of  spoiler  questions on this site. Who kills this guy in this film? How many times does this happen in this film? etc etc.The reason I joined this public beta is because, like many of you, I have a love for movies. Here is an example question that I would love to ask: Who are the cinematographers that you would regard as seminal, and why? and regarding this, what are some classic films that I should watch to see their work? Now this question would not be allowed, because it is subjective. However it seems like this would be a GREAT place to ask it. Where else is there such a well structured site with such a great and knowledgeable fan base? So my question is, will these kinds of questions be allowed? Or is this just going to be a site dedicated to movie trivia? I d love to be able to look at questions like this and see a big list of films to watch that people have talked about and decided on. A bit like this question: EDIT - I propose we allow kind of list question on the site. I for one would love to be able to look up a question which tells me what the best anime films to watch if I ve never seen any before, or for music, or some quintessential noir films, zombie films, romantic films etc. I would also add that disallowing subjective answers on a site dedicated to an artform - which is inherently subjective, does not make sense.The rule for non-subjective questions came from these sites being initially set up for technical topics (like stack overflow) where it is essential to provide factual, canonical answers.  "
"I think those question are very interesting and get some great discussions. I would also like to ask people for recommendations, but at the end of the day this is a question and answer site and those answers are too subjective and are better suited to chat  or a movie forum. Also, you can t really accept an answer that is always true. Maybe you accept Fred s answer of 3 movies but then the next month I come back with a list that totally blows Fred s out of the water. "
"I just hit the reputation cap, and I am not sure that s a good thing or not. Currently the privileges are relaxed. So I assume when public beta opens the privileges causing a gap in what we were once able to do for example close and re-open questions 3000     Vote to close, reopen, or migrate any questions Is there any reason against relaxing reputation cap during private beta? "
"I noticed that many questions asked on this page are about more complex aspects of older movies like Inception. I think this is great and analysing these movies is one of the reasons why I love this site. On the other hand however there are only a handful questions regarding current cinema blockbusters and newly released titles like The Hunger Games, Iron Sky or The Grey for example. I believe however that these are exactly the topics that would attract a lot of search engine traffic and help us get more people on the site. You google the new movie you just saw in the cinema, you end up here and you start browsing other interesting questions. And  BAM , you are hooked! Just look at my question aboutTitanic 3D , it got more than 800 views in 4 days which is ridiculously high compared to the usual view/day ratio of questions here. So my question is: What can we actively do to encourage more questions about freshly released movies? Gaming.SE had an interesting approach to the problem with the promotional grant, where they gave out new games as a gift and in return the users have to ask a bunch of question about the new game. I could imagine a similiar incentive in the form of cinema vouchers, but I am not sure how practical this would be and probably this is out of the question while being in beta anyway. Any other ideas? "
"I have reversed this for the time being.  That was my doing as I could not see many  history  related questions being written here, but you do make a good point. "
"Tags start out detailing what the  author  believes the question to be, but they are molded by the  readers  to refine what it really is, and aids the searching capability later on.  If questions are meant to be only in the here-and-now, any tag (or none) would be sufficient. Everything currently stays on the front page for days.  Later audiences will use the tags to acclimate and find that rare gold question (no offense, gold is in the eye of the beholder) that is buried on the back pages. Consider the broad user base you/we all wish to have; help them find with the  broadest  possible search terms in the way of tags.  Remember the line from Chariots of Fire:  I believe that s a question for the committee...  Answered by:  We ARE the committee!   So, we can make this anything we want, but let s not make it pleasing just to ourselves. "
"I ve been trying to evaluate the percentages of users, hits, votes, etc. some of the requirements on gold badges (100 votes) seem to be on par with a site that has the traffic and use of StackOverflow.While I appreciate the goal of having the same calibre of SO, are the bars reasonable? "
I think these questions are on topic for this site and fairly useful.  I have actually used these tags to learn about new movies that may be interesting to see. I have also used one of these tags to answer the question of what movie I saw a while back that had been nagging at me that after searching Google and talking to my friends who are movie fans I was still unable to find the title.  After have the question up here for less than a day I finally received a solution. 
What s wrong with Spoiler? I usually read all the spoiler first before deciding whether a movie is worth watching or not. 
"I always thought that this question is too broad (and therefore not a real question), each example has a very special explanation, which can or should be explained in its own question. LOTR works with camera tricks, Captain America looks like green-screening and the one person playing twins in the social network is something very special too. There is general name for all these thing: Special Effects, but I don t think that here is any  science  that explains all 3 Effects. "
"Also, another way to help the site is to participate in the Topic of the Week that s going on.  One way to participate is to give us suggestions on what to run and when.  Just because we have something scheduled for a certain time slot doesn t mean we re completely sold on running that topic, so if you can think of something better please let us know. "
Can we ask for suggestions on which TV series/movie to watch of a particular genre? Let s say I want to know all the TV series that are similar to Big Bang Theory  and would want to know which one of them is a better option and why. 
"You love your site and we love your site, but there is a whole world of people out there who might not even know it exists.

"I was introduced to this website last year, during the course of searching for the name of a movie. Not long ago, I found out that the identification function is not something about which everyone is enthusiastic; however, I continue playing the role of a somewhat unwelcome user by replying mostly to identification questions. To me, that s a way of paying back my debt to the community and something I could do with Google s help; the other kinds of questions require that you must actually watch the movies.I wholeheartedly agree that if the original purpose of the forum is to facilitate the exchange of ideas, then identification questions should be banned. However, I don t think that it is fair to say that they are of interests only to the questioner; in fact, I believe they are the only kind of question that can be of some service to people who haven t watched the movies being asked about. From the descriptions, those users may find out about enjoyable movies that they never heard about. Meanwhile, I don t suppose anyone could be interested in discussions on details of movies they haven t watched and have no idea what is being talked about. Moreover, in most cases, questions are usually important to the persons who ask them; they probably never occurred to others who have watched the movies and even after they have been asked, do not stimulate new interests in the mind of many of those people, either because they already know the answer, or simply watch movies for fun, not for contemplation on the contents - the way most of us watch movies. So, to repeat my point, I think it is rather safe to assume that identification questions are the kind of question that are most able and most likely to generate interests in others. I agree with the rest of the points made by proponents of banning if their premises (about the purpose of this forum) are true. "

" I am starting a new web application in PHP and this time around I want to create something that people can extend by using a plugin interface.

" Consider using a ManualReset Event to block the main thread at the end of its processing, and call  Reset()  on it once the timers processing has finished.  If this is something that needs to run constantly, consider moving this into a service process instead of a console app. "
" You can use something like  Console.ReadLine()  to block the main thread, so other background threads (like timer threads) will still work. You may also use an AutoResetEvent to block the execution, then (when you need to) you can call Set() method on that AutoResetEvent object to release the main thread. Also ensure that your reference to Timer object doesnt go out of scope and garbage collected. "
" Why dont you want to use triggers.  They are a good thing if you use them correctly.  If you use them as a way to enforce referential integrity that is when they go from good to bad.  But if you use them for monitoring, they are not really considered taboo. "

" Heres a general description of a technique for calculating pi that I learnt in high school. 
 I only share this because I think it is simple enough that anyone can remember it, indefinitely, plus it teaches you the concept of Monte-Carlo methods -- which are statistical methods of arriving at answers that dont immediately appear to be deducible through random processes. 
 Draw a square, and inscribe a quadrant (one quarter of a semi-circle) inside that square (a quadrant with radius equal to the side of the square, so it fills as much of the square as possible) 
 Now throw a dart at the square, and record where it lands -- that is, choose a random point anywhere inside the square. Of course, it landed inside the square, but is it inside the semi-circle? Record this fact. 
 Repeat this process many times -- and you will find there is a ratio of the number of points inside the semi-circle versus the total number thrown, call this ratio x. 
 Since the area of the square is r times r, you can deduce that the area of the semi circle is x times r times r (that is, x times r squared). Hence x times 4 will give you pi.  
 This is not a quick method to use. But its a nice example of a Monte Carlo method. And if you look around, you may find that many problems otherwise outside your computational skills can be solved by such methods. "

" The version of  Subclipse (1.2.4)  currently available through Aptanas automatic  Plugins Manager  does not work with the newest version of Subversion. 
 I see on the Subclipse website however that they have 1.4.2 out for Eclipse. So I added a new remote update site to my Update manager. When I tried to install it, it told me I needed  Mylyn 3.0.0 . So after much searching I found Mylyn 3.0.0 and added another new remote update site to my update manager. Then when I tried to install that, it told me I needed  org.eclipse.ui 3.3.0  or equivalent. 
 Looking at the configuration details for Aptana, it looks like it is built against eclipse 3.2.2. 
 Does anyone know if there is a way to upgrade the version of Eclipse Aptana that is built against to 3.3.0? Or if there is some other way to get Subclipse to work with the very newest version of Subversion?

" I guess in a managed environment, a leak would be you keeping an unnecessary reference to a large chunk of memory around. "
" I will concur with Bernard as to in .net what a mem leak would be. 
 You could profile your application to see its memory use, and determine that if its managing a lot of memory when it should not be you could say it has a leak. 
 In managed terms I will put my neck on the line to say it does go away once the process is killed/removed. 
 Unmanaged code is its own beast and if a leak exists within it, it will follow a standard mem. leak definition. "
" The best explanation Ive seen is in Chapter 7 of the free Foundations of Programming ebook. 
 Basically, in .NET a memory leak occurs when referenced objects are rooted and thus cannot be garbage collected. This occurs accidentally when you hold on to references beyond the intended scope. 
 Youll know that you have leaks when you start getting outofmemoryexceptions or your memory usage goes up beyond what youd expect (perfmon has nice memory counters).  
 Understanding .NETs memory model is your best way of avoiding it. Specifically, understanding how the garbage collector works and how references work (again, I refer you to chapter 7 of the ebook). Also, be mindful of common pitfalls, probably the most common being events. If object A registered to an event on object B, then object A will stick around until object B disappears because B holds a reference to A. The solution is to unregister your events when youre done.  
 Of course, a good memory profile will let you see your object graphs and explore the nesting/referencing of your objects to see where references are coming from and what root object is responsible (red-gate ants profile, JetBrains dotMemory, memprofiler are really good choices, or you can use the text-only windbg and sos, but Id strongly recommend a commercial/visual product unless youre a real guru). 
I believe unmanaged code is subject to typical memory leaks of unamanged code, except that references shared between the two are managed by the garbage collector. Could be wrong about this last point. "

" Is there an existing application or library in  Java  which will allow me to convert a  CSV  data file to  XML  file?   
 The  XML  tags would be provided through possibly the first row containing column headings. "
" This has religious war potential, but it seems to me that if youre using a getter/setter, you should use it internally as well - using both will lead to maintenance problems down the road (e.g. somebody adds code to a setter that  needs  to run every time that property is set, and the property is being set internally w/o that setter being called). "
" It depends on how the property is used. For example, say you have a student object that has a name property. You could use your Get method to pull the name from the database, if it hasnt been retrieved already. This way you are reducing unnecessary calls to the database. 
 Now lets say you have a private integer counter in your object that counts the number of times the name has been called. You may want to not use the Get method from inside the object because it would produce an invalid count. "
" This may be too basic or limited of a solution, but couldnt you do a  String.split()  on each line of the file, remembering the result array of the first line to generate the XML, and just spit each lines array data out with the proper XML elements padding each iteration of a loop? "
" Another tool to try would be the SQLMaestro suite - http://www.sqlmaestro.com It is a little tricky nailing down the precise tool, but they have a variety of tools, both free and for purchase that handle a wide variety of tasks for multiple database platforms.

" Well, it seems with C# 3.0 properties default implementation, the decision is taken for you; you HAVE to set the property using the (possibly private) property setter. 
 I personally only use the private member-behind when not doing so would cause the object to fall in an less than desirable state, such as when initializing or when caching/lazy loading is involved. "
" As stated in some of the comments: Sometimes you should, sometimes you shouldnt. The great part about private variables is that you are able to see all the places they are used when you change something. If your getter/setter does something you need, use it. If it doesnt matter you decide. 
 The opposite case could be made that if you use the getter/setter and somebody changes the getter/setter they have to analyze all the places the getter and setter is used internally to see if it messes something up. "
 Does anyone know of a good way to compress or decompress files and folders in C# quickly? Handling large files might be necessary.

Questions like How do instant runoffs work? clearly arent opinionated. The challenge will be more with drawing the line with semi-objective questions.
 Casebash of course. Thats another aspect to figure out as we go too.
"Once a site reaches critical mass, things like this will be inevitable and unstoppable. I agree though that during the initial ramp up we should err on the side of caution to set the best possible example of what is expected."
We should allow the country meta-tag in order for someone to illustrate that his question may be only related to a specific country. If the question is of interest for a broader audience we can still tag it that way.
"StackExchange sites tend to focus more on engaging the experts than average users under the belief that if we have experts, then well naturally draw average users. The average user wants questions like Who is better Republicans or Democrats?, that drive experts away."
The average user that asks a question perhaps but the average reader that gets here by googling may find it useful. Even while SE is from experts we should not ignore how users find the page ;).
Should we really be asking is x stronger than y? questions in the first place?.
Agreed.  Maybe Moose-Jaw has a unique political climate that we can learn lessons from.  Start out by giving tags the benefit of the doubt and then see how things pan out in the coming months.
" jrg I think the first question should be considered off topic, as it has very little to do with the political process, but the second one should be considered kosher, because it concerns a political process, though, there might be other problems with the question unrelated to it being campaign advice."

"The solution to avoid flame wars is for everyone to state their answers in a neutral fashion. ie. Dont bring the question into talking about Democrats and Republicans when the question doesnt ask about it. If someone posts an unnecessarily partisan response, downvote it."
 Casebash Ive seen people on other SE sites not do that over 2 years after a linux distro changed a (albeit fairly major) part of the desktop. I only shudder to think of the mess politics.SE would be if we allowed stuff like this. :(
"Casebash As asked, thats on the line, but more on the non-constructive side. Someone who has been researching the topic _could_ narrow it down in an answer, citing a specific organization, tax(es) and showing the result. But, its the questions job to set such constraints - its a bit too open ended as is. It should be edited, or closed until the OP is able to narrow it down."
"Ok, so you think that questions like How much would policy X reduce emissions by? or How much immigration would occur if we adopted an open border? or What would be the economic impact of banning fracking? would be on topic?."
" toscho Hm? I know, thats why I added them both ;)."
"Id much prefer `USA` - its immediately obvious and short, and probably faster to auto complete (I would imagine people start typing U, then S when looking for a tag about the US)."
"Well, scotland for example has its own political systems. Id say down to major cities level (capitals and any other large cities of international interest [capitals of states, most populated in large countries like the USA])"
"Too much of a barrier?  Probably.  But my experience with science, engineering, and economics is that simple, straight forward neutral questions often have surprising and counter-intuitive answers, when(if) the harsh light of Science shines on them."

"One problem is that islamism is a very controversial (and potentially offensive to a large group of people) term, and grouping various distinct movements under it is... argh... controversial?"
" YannisRizos Hmm. Do you know of a less provocative term that has the same broadly-accepted meaning (i.e. the conviction that all the political institutions of the world should be organized in accordance with the precepts of Sharia, as defined by the movement in questions adherents)? The only near-synonym that doesnt include the letters I, s, l, a and m that I can think of is Qutbism, and, well, I can imagine that word causing a lot of people to scratch their heads in confusion."
"All of those would still be in scope, under my proposal, because the are either quasi governments or seek to influence such governments, or both. ... This is different from the politics of, say, who does what, in the bake sale."
"That was a simple typo. I pointed out problems, and at least 4 other people seem to agree.  So in, addition, the question is not clear. And the question stated, `reappraisal of goals, tactics etc. within such movements`.  My proposed title was fully in line with what the question text asked.  (We cant read minds.)"
"In my opinion, its too narrow to limit it to the force of law. That would exclude any multi-national entity (such as EU or UN) without an army. It would also exclude political parties and sub-national entities that dont have control over the police."
"I agree with this. It should be sufficient to tag such questions with the state or party they are associated with, or the ideology which best represents them."
"Commonwealth of Nations, normally referred to as the Commonwealth and formerly known as the British Commonwealth, is an intergovernmental organisation of 54 independent member states. It is bigger than the EU, it is just like saying US is interchangeable. United States could refer to some nations who decided to work together (They are then united states) or the united Mexican states."
"What about What methods have been *proposed*?. In my opinion, its a bit sad if we can only discuss things that have been tried."
*the Commonwealth* is still different than the concept of a commonwealth nation. I agree with your other merge though.

"What is perceived as an advantage depends on the effects for the judging person. This is not constructive. We made this error (allowing list questions) on wordpress.se too, and now our [most popular question](http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/1567/best-collection-of-code-for-your-functions-php-file) is an embarrassing collection we cannot delete anymore. Really, we should focus on specific, constructive questions and keep everything else out."
"To be clear: my preference would be to have moderators with diverse viewpoints, rather than identical centrist ones (partly because I doubt wed all agree on what constitutes centrist, and partly because I think checks and balances is a good model for governance). In the case of a Speaker-type role: yes, the good ones need not be politically centrist, but their affiliation *is* usually well-known, and the wish to avoid being accused of favouring their own side might in fact help them to remain demonstrably purer-than-pure."
"Youre right, my speaker analogy is flawed for the reason youre stating."
Already the selection of topics to ask questions about reveals something.
"Will the `bug` tag automatically result in SE staff seeing this, or should it also be reported on meta.stackoverflow?"
"From your own link: If your meta site does not have a post to nominate Moderators, start one now! Pro Tem appointments will begin about two weeks after the site is created. The more guidance we receive, the more informed our choice so while yes, the decision is theirs, it doesnt hurt to have nominations and votes from the community as to who they want :)"
Halfway through the question I thought I knew exactly where this was going: mods should keep their political affiliations secret to avoid controversy. You went a different direction with it
"Past affiliations dont matter, from the moment they become moderators,"
"Even if a Law SE did exist, I think law and government are just too entwined to separate. The same can be said for history and politics, even though we have a thriving history community."
"Note: You guys dont get to _elect_ mods yet. You can nominate candidates and comment/vote on them, but in this case the final decision is in the hands of SE. They will use your nomination meta post as a _guide_ to choose potential candidates, contact them for confirmation, and then choose them. Sometimes a mod is chosen who never nominated himself on the thread."
"Ive only voted on one of the answers you link to, and my political affiliations had little to do with my vote."
"I totally agree, and I will support any attempt to enforce such a rule if the community agrees on it!"
"Politics, by its nature, is a very controversial subject. We need to draw a distinct line on what will lead to a specific answer, and what will lead to controversy. Things like Are conservatives better then liberals are obviously non-constructive, but how about harder questions such as Is a democracy stronger then a republic?. Harder questions are sure to appear, so where should we draw this line?. "
"As part of The 7 Essential Meta Questions of Every Beta this question is intended to solicit ideas and commentary for site-specific FAQ entries. Anyone is welcome to suggest entries and discuss proposals, and votes should be used to show agreement or disagreement with a proposal. Remember that votes on Politics meta do not have any effect on your site rep, so dont be afraid to downvote!  "
"I think a major potential issue for this site is going to be bias - in fact, quickly after opening in private beta form somewhat ranting questions pushing towards a bias were posted. As such, I think we need to make it clear that as well as discouraging opinionated questions and answers, we try to keep them fairly balanced and discourage bias wherever possible. Weve made a great start to this, lets keep it going by making it official. "
I partially agree ;). I would much more like to have people be able to also post questions about only one side if they do reflect the other side in their question. As an example you could ask about the advantages of dictatorship after having illustrated in your question which disadvantages you consider relevant. While this would allow for questions to be splitted I believe it is much closer to what an average  reader  wants from SE. 
"Campaigning is a  political process , so its at least  nominally  in scope. Our examples/first few questions seem to be centered around policy/political science. Should questions from people aimed at helping them win an election be on topic?. Off the top of my head, those might break down broadly into questions about: Election rules in a specific country (nomination, financing, etc.). Organizing an effective campaign. Fundraising The cost-effectiveness of certain techniques (door knocking, billboards, etc.). 
 "
"We want to ensure that all questions add to the site rather than take away from it and lead to endless argument. For example, Are conservatives better then liberals? will end up with all of the standard kinds of partisan responses. However, What are the main policy differences between conservatives and liberals? can be answered in a neutral manner (with overly partisan responses being downvoted). The most important point is that posts that argue their position well should be upvoted, even if you dont agree with their conclusion. Posts that argue their position poorly should be downvoted even if you agree with them. "
I agree with this as long as the premise of the question being asked is about Domestic matters. For Foreign Affairs and Foreign Relations questions however it seems silly to require that all affected countries be tagged as often foreign relationships and conflicts affect the world. 
"I think Skeptics does an incredibly good job of keeping noise out and keeping the questions on topic, but what I ultimately fear and think that others should too is that Politics will eventually become a focused clique much like Skeptics is currently. Their are a handful of extremely high rep users on Skeptics that also happen to be the mods and a throng of disatisfied low rep lurkers who are too afraid to contribute anything, no matter how small. The over zealous nature of Skeptics to snub out anything but the most perfect and pristine answers has effectively created this dysfunctional community, and a rather unimpressive rate of questions being asked for a site no longer in beta. I think that references should be encouraged, but lack of references should not be punished by any other means than lack of an upvote or perhaps a downvote for quality.  In other words, answers without references should inherently be considered lower quality though I feel calls for moderator deletion are taking it too far. "
Whilst USA is less ambiguous some people will still use US and United States. I very much doubt that United States is used to refer to the UMS as the USA is more widely referred to/well known. Id say that USA is preferable but united-states and US should be tag synonyms. Perhaps have all merge into united-states-of-america which is in no way an abbreviation nor is it ambiguous. 
"Yes, and its not just to avoid mostly-duplicate questions.  Pretty much   every   real-life issue has both advantages and disadvantges, and often the issue looks very different when the pros and cons are contrasted, For example, suppose my question was:  What are the advantages of this new, In Vitro youth treatment?. I might get answers like, It really makes your skin shine! and Youll never age another day!. But it might not get the truthful answer, They completely enclose your body in glass crystal, preserving you like a moth! - because its not an advantage.  But it  is  important information that put the advantages in perspective.

"Currently, that question has 4 close-votes 1 .  Three of them are for  Off Topic  and one is for  Not a real Question. So the steps to improving this question seem clear: Make it clear that the question is about the political aspects of Islamism.  I would guess that many in the West (rightly or wrongly) see Islam as a religious issue (only).  In fact, one commenter even said as much:  Are you referring to terrorist groups? Or the Islamic religion?. Narrow the focus.  The original question seemed broad enough to require a series of books to answer.  The edited one is still a bit encompassing. Perhaps a title more like: Has the death of Osama bin Laden changed the tactics and/or frequency of attacks by Islamo-terrorist groups like al-Qaeda and Islamic Jihad?. 1  I havent voted to close it, yet, but may in the future.

"Think about tags as subscription options. They should not be a dictionary or replacement for our search engine. Also keep in mind tags get very messy very fast. For these reasons I would restrict tags to  concepts  and leave person names out. It is also difficult to say where to draw the line. Is Al Gore a  political thinker?. What we should do: edit posts to use the full names, so our search engine will show better results. "

"The full name should be used, for a number of reasons. If someone tries to put part of the name (for example, Osama Bin Laden might be tagged Osama, as he is certainly the most known Osama, or Bin Laden, as hes the most known Bil Laden, even though both those names are fairly common in that area of the world) it gets the entire name as the suggested tag. Excellent. Search indexing is a minor concern, but still relevant. You avoid future name collisions. Who is the Kennedy tag for, or Clinton? What would we do if a guy named Steven Reagan wins elected office?. Now, if some other guy named Bill Clinton runs for office and wins, well we can re-address this then."
"I think we  can  go very localised. It may be interesting to read. This question is unlikely to ever help any future visitors; it is only relevant to a small geographic area, a specific moment in time, or an extraordinarily narrow situation that is not generally applicable to the worldwide audience of the internet. on-topic, it might help future visitors. As long as were small, its unlikely; however, its possible. Motivation for the decision of the city council of Belmopan  to temporarily move a bicycle shed by two blocks in 1988 ? too localised, extremely unlikely to ever help anybody. Candidates for the post of secretary for a fringe opposition party in the village council of off-topic for the same reason. As long as this site is small, small questions may be unlikely to help many future visitors. But a site like Stack Overflow has some tags relating to rather obscure programming languages, Movies&amp;TV has tags relating to some rather obscure movies, and Travel permits questions on rather local travel destinations. Localised is relative, and in my opinion, if there is any reasonable hope for a question to be useful to future visitors, we ought to allow it. "
"Are questions about the functioning of the state political? They might be either political or legal. For example, would it be on-topic to ask: Is action X by president Y unconstitutional?  or  Do increased police powers correlate with a reduction in violent crime?  or  Do jury-based systems have significantly less/more false convictions than non-jury based systems?. All those questions may be asked in the political process, so they may be <a policy questions , but maybe they are too far from the core of the site to be considered on-topic?. "
"Id say there are a few options in this and similar scenarios: to keep with the idea of keep it balanced, create your own answer combining whats said to show both sides. Personally Id create it as a community wiki so as not to look like Im trying to steal the rep from the others make a comment on each answer asking if either would consider editing to take into account both arguments make a comment on your question that you would like an answer that takes into account both arguments and leave it open.

"The problem is that to fit the site around this would take away from the Q&amp;A format and move towards a discussion, something which is not the purpose of SE. If a discussion is what youre after, youd be better off finding a politics forum or maybe even using chat once were out of private beta and we have more activity. "
"Yes, Just the facts does hurt the site, since hard facts are in short supply regarding politics. I personally hope we can find a way to list and weigh (via votes)  Theories , but not mere opinions.  Many important and interesting political questions have only theories and little or no science (yet). Ideally, this site could become a seedbed to inspire or concentrate  objective  information. 
However, that question deserves to be closed irregardless. t starts off stating an unsupported opinion as fact.  (There is no hard data linking corruption with fundraising.)  The question asks for the Best, which not only is  an open-ended invitation for opinionated, unproductive debate ; but it encourages the fallacy that we can/should try only one measure at a time 1 . It deals in absolutes 2 .  Eliminate versus reduce.  This encourages defeatism, letting the Perfect be the enemy of the good.  History shows that we cant eliminate corruption, but we should strive mightily to reduce it.  A better title (and premise) might be something like: What are practical ways to guard against corruption (if any) tied to fundraising? . 1  One measure at a time is optimum for a scientific study, but not necessarily for trying to eliminate a pressing human problem. 
2  Insert obligatory  Star Wars  quote here. "
"This is an interesting question!. I believe we have to be a little sensitive around this issue, as some may consider their political leaning or affiliation rather private. It could be argued that someones political beliefs are as private as their religious beliefs, and I would not want to require anyone to disclose those (though personally I am happy to disclose either). While I understand and agree that we need to keep things as neutral as possible, disclosure could result in effective discrimination whether positive or negative by those who do not share those views. I will update the Temporary Moderators question to explain that we expect any moderators to remain neutral in their moderation activities. I think this is an area where we need to judge people by their actions rather than their beliefs, and we would need the support of SE to keep this in check. "
"I can confirm this as well. I first registered on Dec 4th UTC on my tablet, but didnt notice until this morning that I was being rejected from a non-mobile browser.

What the electorate can do instead is to closely scrutinise comments and close-votes made by candidate-moderators, and everybody can judge by themselves if they consider the candidate-moderator to be sufficiently neutral or not. Its a bit like the speaker/president of a parliament. Should they be from a centrist party as to be neutral? Hopefully not; for a good speaker/president of parliament will treat all parliamentarians equal, whether communists, liberals or fascists, regardless of their own political leaning. "
"Hm... This is tricky. SE generally seems biased against large scale edits that change the substance of the post... therefore unilaterally editing the bits out seems a bad idea. I would say that the standard SO approach would probably work: Downvote  Post a comment very explicitly explaining what needs to be done to remove the downvote (e.g. please back up statement X with facts or edit it out). If you feel that the question is worth an upvote except for this one flaw, state so, this will give the poster extra incentive to improve. Very important  - Go back and do as you promised if the user did add facts or edited out. Undownvote, or upvote if the question is worth it. Also, in truly egregious cases (e.g. the answer is awash in unbackedup-opinions) but has too many upvotes (e.g. from partisan upvoting) for the OP to care about your single downvote, raise the issue on Meta. If active community members agree that there is a problem and form a consensus, we can request that Moderators or high-rep users delete the answer. "

"Forum Romanum or Forum Magnum  The Roman Forum (Latin: Forum Romanum, Italian: Foro Romano) is a rectangular forum (plaza) surrounded by the ruins of several important ancient government buildings at the center of the city of Rome. Citizens of the ancient city referred to this space, originally a marketplace, as the Forum Magnum, or simply the Forum. It was for centuries the center of Roman public life: the site of triumphal processions and elections, venue for public speeches, criminal trials, and gladiatorial matches, and nucleus of commercial affairs. Here statues and monuments commemorated the citys great men. The teeming heart of ancient Rome, it has been called the most celebrated meeting place in the world, and in all history. Located in the small valley between the Palatine and Capitoline Hills, the Forum today is a sprawling ruin of architectural fragments and intermittent archeological excavations attracting numerous sightseers.

"As a rule, the answer is yes. nonessential opinionated material should not be in the posts. However, what one considers nonessential opinionated material is frequently subjective and in the eye of the be(er)holder. Orthogonally, a very good suggested policy is to  comment  on an answer, pointing out what you consider offensive bits, and explain why you feel it should be edited for improvement. Its more neighborly than unilaterally making a major edit yourself, AND more importantly, lets the poster have a chance to explain why they may disagree. Beats getting into Wikipedia style edit/rollback wars :) One caveat: if theres a clear evidence (via many comments/downvotes) that a specific piece of an answer is subjective opinion from many eyes, you may be better off editing it out yourself pre-emptively, lest an otherwise good post gets downvoted into oblivion. Then, post-edit, explain what and why you did in a comment (and for a new user, inform them of a rollback option). "

"Wikipedia being notoriously opinionated and subjective on politics related topics  not exactly true.  Thats easy to assume considering the nature of Wikipedia where all people are allowed to edit a page, but If you read a political Wikipedia article, and then venture outside of Wikipedia to read articles elsewhere, you will likely find that the Wikipedia article is the most unbiased of your findings. but on topic, Even if theres a good Wikipedia article out there which addresses a particular question, It is very likely to be a lot broader and longer than a good answer, which should be  more concise and to the point(and perhaps more detailed too).  Wikipedia is a great resource, but It isnt a Q&amp;A site. "
"Im not 100% clear on what youre asking here, but Ill give it a go. Questions regarding Parliamentary procedures are in general on-topic, provided that they relate directly to the running of a  political  body or organisation. Questions related to when those same rules are used outside of and unrelated to the political landscape such as in a private organisation (perhaps to run their AGM or similar) are off-topic. "
"The issue with reference requests in a field like politics is that to a very large degree, even the  facts  on a particular topic can be quite subjective.  I agree with a lot of what @Alenanno has to say in his response but fear that these types of questions will result in a litany of materials because each political viewpoint will offer up a collection of readings reinforcing their own facts. In addition to the number of responses and the length of lists such questions are likely to generate, these types of questions would be quite a challenge to successfully moderate to ensure only the most factual, unbiased selections are allowed to stand. As such, I vote no on these types of questions. "

What contributes to the political power of X is asking for  opinions  so should be off topic. Good Questions - what notable achievements did X accomplish during their term? - What was Candidate Xs position on abortion? - Has X ever publicly address scandal y? Who supports President Obama? is not constructive on its own.  If the question were asked in context of a constructive question I might reconsider but as a standalone there is nothing to be gained but discussion(which is not constructive). 
"This question falls into the category of is X better than Y?  So it is asking for  opinions rather than facts. Besides that for every small country you can put up that is run well we could point out its flaws versus pretty much any other country. Even if the type of debate that this type of question is likely to solicit were acceptable, this question would require at least 3 volumes to answer completely.  It would require in depth analysis of different governements and analysis of statistics that would make the AHCA look like a beach read. You could ask specific questions like do smaller countries generally have a lower Debt to GDP ratio, crime rate or other statistic. This allows for an apples to apples comparison of facts rather than a subjective comparison of qualities that are important to the poster.  I suspect that my priorities of good governing are practically opposite of many of the users here. @lechlukasz mentioned another context where this question could be workable and that would be asking about Political Science Theory rather than about actual results(which is how it is phrased).  I still think this question is just too broad.  But if you focused on an aspect (like size of government required) then it would be a good question when focused on theory. "
"Three separate reasons: You didnt define better, therefore any answer will be subjective. Your latter attempt to objectify this (happiness index) is also subjective visavi the subject of the question. Happiness index has not been proven to correlate to good governance (or even to good quality conditions), so suggesting using it as a proxy doesnt help the question substantively. How to fix? Pick a specific objective criteria to evaluate by (and either dont mention good governance, or show how its a good proxy). Even if/after you defined some objective criteria, the questions would still be of the form I state that X set satisfies criteria Y, why?, without any proof that X set actually satisfies criteria Y in the first place. It might be correct, but you should either ask Does set X satisfy Y, and if so, why? or provide the Does? answer yourself. It seems your latter edit somewhat fixes this, reformulating into is there a correlation, but this poses a separate problem (not worthy of closing, however) of who cares about correlation and why should we? :)  
 Your latter attempt at defining the set X (coherent group of countries) also doesnt seem very clearly defined. On what basis can France not be compared to Haiti? (im not saying that it should be compared, but that you didnt elucidate the reasons not to explicitly).

"I have also that impression. There are more and more questions asking for  arguments  for theoption the author believe, and to use against other side. That are formulated such as what are the arguments  against  etc. So the question is already biased, and answers representing other point of view are even more likely to be downvoted. My promotor have said once that the best theses are those which prove that the initial assumption was wrong. Maybe it would be good to take rules from the Sceptics.SE, where each answer must have bibliography. This would close the sites for many users, for example me, who have all books from study times in other country and anyway they were non-English :) But it could save the site from dying and closing.

"I think in general practice this is the right approach, and would have helped out this question quite a bit, however, I am afraid that a blanket rule risks deflating the effectiveness of some questions that require an accurate description of one sides argument in order to be of value to the questioner. Questions of the sort It is my understanding that party X believes Y.  However, this seems to conflict with party Xs belief Z.  In what way does party X reconcile these distinct opinions?, for example, would not get to the root of the questioners inquiry if rewritten: What are the common arguments for and against beliefs Y and Z?  Here a particular partisan take on the question is required to answer appropriately. "

"And the rule *is* that they have to be onsides at the kick, not when the ball passes the defender."
"you are correct - I meant in the context of the traditional goalie being in the goalbox and the defensive player being further up the field. I guess if the goalie ever came out far enough to not be the last defender than you would need to take the second-last defender rule into account. And yes, that *is* the rule - which is why I usually chose to call it that way rather than what I was told I should do. This was just youth soccer games though - I think you guys are talking more about the official FIFA rules."

"MarcusSwope: It may have been difficult to do it sooner. Youll notice that the player who scored realized what was going on and tried to stop, but couldnt. If they had tried to permit a score a minute or so earlier (which actually would have been a very good strategy by the win probability numbers), the players would have had further to go and would have been able to stop before reaching the endzone. At that point, the game would have been essentially over."
"I am curious of that myself. I believe they let at least one more play happen than was necessary *and* they made the tackle in bounds, letting even more time run off the clock."

"I personally think it was the right decision. I Googled for did the patriots make the right decision letting giants score and the top two results indicated that he made the right decision. Obviously if his team had scored, then **everyone** would have thought it was a good decision.

Voted to close as not constructive since questions of type What is the best... typically yield subjective answers and a long discussion instead of a definitive answer.

Thanks Peter. I will now be grossed out any time I step into a pool ~ever again~.
You might want to be a little more specific - ball handling ability? jumping ability? shooting accuracy? defense? There are a lot of areas in basketball you can improve on.

glowcoder I can see where you are coming from and I tried arguing this before but most of the time questions like this turn into a mess unfortunately.
Totally agree with  jamauss. At the moment this question is too broad.
edited to be more specific about ball-handling rather than general basketball ability.
Agreed. Teams seem to think so too - the most expensive seats in NFL stadiums (other than the luxury boxes) tend to be in the section between the two 40-yard lines.
"Im not discussing fitness swimming, but a training concern for the sport of swimming. According to the faq, this is for participants in team and individual sport activities."
Combination of quick passing and movement is definitely the key to breaking the zone. Addition to the outside shot strategy: this will only work with slow defenders in top zones. Guys who are quick on their feet will get in your face even when youre on the 3pt line so youll have to work extra hard to set up an open shot.
"Obscure record: AR, or Area Record, e.g. European Record, Asian Record, etc. The Areas are formally defined by the IAAF, I think there are six. Confusing this is the American use of AR to mean American Record."

"Note that the involvement in the play is now defined quite explicitly in the Laws of the Game (and their official interpretation): Either playing or touching the ball, or preventing an opponent from playing or being able to play the ball by clearly obstructing his vision or movements or making a deceiving or distracting gesture or movement, or playing a rebound ball having been in an offside position.

If the question was edited to address competitive running (as well as not be a shopping question as wax eagle noted) then I would vote to re-open."
"I can see substitutions been made when you have 5/10/15+ minutes left for these reasons, but Im literally talking about substitutions being made in the 89/90th minutes/ during injury time. Surely if the motivation of the manager was for these reasons, they would do it sooner?."
"Geoffc gives a lot of good points, especially to test how much you sweat, dont just trust estimates - every body is different. You will also sweat A LOT more depending on temperature, altitude, etc. Once you get past an hour or two, you also need to start thinking about electrolytes (salt) and calories. Yes, you can get by without it, but your performance will hurt without it. For runs longer than that, it can be dangerous to only drink pure water, and not replace electrolytes, a condition called hyponatremia. At these distances, consider a Camelbak."

"Well the injury time is typically 5 minutes or so, so at the 89th minute you have 5 minutes left. I think it would apply less when theres 15 minutes to go. Your fresh legs are out there so they can burst onto the scene. Its like the difference between sprinting and distance. You give it all you have in sprinting. If you did distance like you sprinted, youd exhaust very quickly. These fresh legs go out there and sprint, giving them a huge advantage. But the longer theyre out there, the less effective they are. Id say you only want them out for 5, maybe 8 minutes."
"MikeHedman Hyponatremia sucks!  Been there, often, alas.  I sweat so much over a long race day, that I literally just eat a salt packet every hour or so.  3g every hour or two is enough to keep up."

"Yes -- Ive watched those videos, I linked to the second in my post...

" If a defense is facing a tough situation with no timeouts left, it is difficult to stop the clock. Your options are very limited - you hope the offense passes and you can bat it down, or you hope you can push your opponent out of bounds. If you are very close to the goal line, there is little to be lost in terms of yardage, especially compared to what is gained from stopping the clock (namely, more time for your team to score next). Can you simply line up, encroach, and get a penalty for it? "
"Sitting front row at the 50 yard line gives a spectator an intense (and expensive) view of a small focal point of an American football field. Sitting higher up gives a spectator a better overall field view, but keeps a fan from enjoying the full violence of the game. Sitting in the corner gives a great view of a single endzone, but the opposite endzone can appear a mile away, and your team (presuming you have one) will only score in that endzone during a single half (which a ticket buyer cannot predict prior to the coinflip). With all this in mind, what seat in the average American football stadium offers the best overall view? What about best view for ones buck? ."
"I used to help ref soccer games when I was younger and the way I was taught to call the off-sides penalty was that if the player on offense was beyond the last defender (goalie doesnt count obviously)  before  the ball was also beyond the last defender, then the player is off-sides. Some people (myself included) think the way it should be called is that the player on offense needs to be even with the defender, but should be allowed to pursue the ball as soon as it is passed to them, regardless of their position relative to the other teams defensive players. In other words - let one players speed and instinct give them an advantage - rather than a penalty. "
"Hopefully the marathon distance should be obvious: its a standard distance in athletics, although its actual length (42.2km, 26.2 miles) is irregular. The distance originally varied, in the neighborhood of 24-25 miles, but became standardized after the 1908 London Olympics. "
How would you practice basketball zone defence with less than 10 people available? I understand that you can put 5 on defence and the rest available in offence but it simply would not produce as much movement in the offence to really practice good one movement. What is a good technique to simulating/compensating for missing offence players? (E.g. is it possible to get 3 offence players to make offence plays on one side of the court first then switch to the other side?) Reference to some professional materials (books etc.) would be much appreciated. 
"As an ice hockey goalie, I find it a bit hard to determine the correct length for my stick while at the store.

While I generally have never picked one that is absurdly longer or shorter that affects me during a game, I cant help but feel like I may at times have chosen incorrectly and could be putting myself at a slight disadvantage that could be affecting my posture and position. Is there a way to determine what is a correct length or perhaps a checklist I should go through while at the store to make sure Ive chosen a proper length for my stick? "

"If its that big of a deal for you, Id bring my skates with me, to be honest. As a defenseman, Ive just gotten used to the size I need, although it changes based on the manufacturer of the blade (some blades are taller than others and affect the overall height), but that bit of randomness isnt big enough to bother me. I would think the biggest deal for you as a goalie would be the lie of the stick, and that shouldnt change once youve decided which fits you the best. "

"When you bail on a snowboard a multitude of nasty things can happen due to the facts that you are strapped to the board and that the board is great at catching snow with its edges. So you may end up tumbling, twisting your joints and spraining muscles in the process. The question is : once you realised you are destined to fall what is the effective way of minimising the risk of serious injury (or simply minimising the risk of tumbling and/or stopping in an awkward position with a twisted knee)?. One things I saw and tried is to rotate onto your back as soon as possible and slide on your back while lifting the feet with the board up to avoid catching the snow and causing a tumble. Is this safe? How could you get into such position quickly? Is there a better approach?. And please, dont tell me not to fall - I already try not to :).  Bonus : Is there a good technique to quickly recover from a fall? I.e. use the residual momentum of to get up and get going again quickly (if you arent hurt of course)."

Have you tried using a professionally made orthotic (not the one you buy in the store)? These are custom made for your foot and should give you the proper support so that you dont hurt while skating. Note that it takes your body a while to adjust to orthotics. Your doctor should give you a schedule for breaking them in. Also a wide boot helps. Ive always found that Bauer skates have much wider models available.

"Not a scientific answer, but one from a lot of experience... Dont run faster during your jog periods.  If you dont recover during these times, you wont perform optimally during your intervals. Addressing the safety part: only change one aspect each workout.  So in your next run you might try running at a faster pace, but keep the durations constant.  Then next week, keep your pace at its new, faster rate, and bump up the durations a bit.  But running faster for a longer time is an invitation to injury. "
"If you have an interval setting thats working out for you, perhaps instead of trying to adjust it, you could adjust other factors at your disposal. Is there an incline feature, causing you to be moving uphill? This will give you the ability to substantially increase your challenge over time. I grew up in a very hilly area and always found great pleasure and challenge in tackling the hills the long way up. Another thing to consider is that if this is just to keep up your conditioning, perhaps you shouldnt alter this run. Instead, focus on runs where you do have more flexibility and less time constraints. If this is on your lunch break, is a more challenging run going to interfere with your afternoon of work? "
"I have used runtastic and Daily Mile and of course there is Garmin, but what mobile applications besides these are most popular for running and/or fitness and why? Im looking to see what other features are out there that I dont have. "
"In that particular situation, the Patriots were allowing the Giants to score because of 2 important reasons.  The Giants were already in scoring position - well within field goal range and The Patriots only had a slim lead (2 points) - so a field goal from the Giants would mean they would be trailing and need to get the ball back and score again. So they allowed the Giants to score in order to get possession of the ball back ASAP to try and re-gain the lead. "
"If you have great confidence in your players, and expect them to be able to make an equal score given enough time, then you may be willing to let your opponent score NOW so your team has more time for a score of their own. Obviously this is a very,  very  risky decision. If you happen to not score on that possession (as the Patriots did) you lose the game. The counter argument is if the opponent runs out the clock and kicks a field goal on the last play, youll lose the game anyway. For what its worth, the football community as a whole is divided on whether this was particular instance was a good decision or not. "
"As wax eagle stated, this is an extremely subjective question and really depends on what youre there to see. That being said... For the average fan, I would say the best seat would be the 50 yard line, 10 to 20 rows back. It gives the centre location that will allow you to see as much of the potential play as possible, and the distance back from the field will allow you to have a better view of the field as the plays are executed, instead of the backs of the players. "
"What gameplays do you use to attack a zone defense, and specially 2-1-2 type? And how do you work it in practice?. I usually practice it with game situation, but are there some exercises to develop team level?. I also appreciate if you have videos, articles or book to recommend. "
"As far as that decision that was made it was based on the clock game, confidence in your players, and a calculated risk.  If the Pats tried to hold the Giants to a field goal then sure the points gap would be smaller but so would the time on the clock.  Coach Belichick has great confidence in Tom Brady and, based on how quickly they have been moving down the field, just hoped that that full minute was enough to score. "
"One of the things that I find myself not doing as well as I need to is keeping my eye on the ball. I am a tennis player but I am sure this could apply to other sports as well (baseball, football, racquetball, squash, cricket) that require players to keep their eye on the ball. I have heard of doing things like getting different colored markers and drawing colored shapes on the ball and continually trying to figure out what color the shape is on the ball - are there any other drills that could help in this area of focus?."
"Questions about rules, equipment and training related to competitive running."
"While watching American football, I frequently hear about one gap or two gap techniques when referring to defensive linemen. I found this terminology to be a bit unclear, so I looked for an explanation online. I found a few articles like this one . What is the primary difference between these techniques? It seems that the way the defensive linemen are lined up and their defensive responsibilities are the main factors. My understanding is that one gap defender is lined up between two offensive linemen and only worries about the gap between his opponents, while a two gap defender is lined up directly across from an offensive lineman and has to defend the space on either side of the blocker. From the diagram, it seems that 3-4 defensive linemen would tend to be two gap defenders, while 4-3 defensive linemen tend to be one gap defenders. Is my understanding correct? 
 Is there a simpler way of explaining these techniques? "

"Before the serve is executed the teamplayers at the net can raise their arms and move in between the server and the receiver to take position at the net. They cannot move to get in the way when the server starts serving. Its a fine line, I think it depends on the referee.  "
"In modern soccer, the formation is not a rigid structure, and the player positions are more flexible. Especially the wingbacks (defenders at the far left and right) combine the functions of a classical full back with a (midfield) winger ? when they get to the ball, they quickly move forward along the side to prepare an attack, often even participating in its final phases (and, therefore, they can sometimes even score a goal). It is obviously important other players know their tasks in such a situation. This is a useful part of modern soccer tactics, and is  prescribed  by managers (well, not always, obviously), not discouraged. "
"This is rare case, but in the event that a disc lands on top of a basket (above the chains and basket in the round area that is often on top of the goal) is it considered holed or does it require an additional throw to actually hole out?. "
"I agree with most of the posters about duration. That is, for longer runs, where the definition of longer is very personal, water at least for hydration is required.  Water bottle holders come in all shapes and sizes now. Fanny packs, which can irritate the small of your back where the bottle top bounces into it. Angled bottle fanny packs, which try to alleviate that pain. Fuel Belt and copycats where there are many small bottles on a belt. Everyone is different, and hydration requirements will differ. You can get an estimate of how much you sweat, and thus need to replace, by starting a workout, fresh, weigh yourself, do your workout, no drinking, for a reasonable amount of time (an hour works well) and then shower, and weigh yourself clean after. Since you cannot appreciably burn off significant mass in an hour of exersize,  you can estimate how much you sweat out.  A litre weighs about a kilo, (which is why Metric is so useful). Worst case is usually 1 to 1.5 litres an hour for heavy sweaters.  If all you are doing is an hour or three then you cannot dig youself too deep into a hole.  However for longer stuff like marathon and long course triathlons, it is important to stay ahead of the drinking and not get into the hole, since you will not be able to get out of it during the race. I am at the heavier end of that sweating scale, and on my first Ironman drank 18 litres on the bike, 8 litres on the run, and lost 7 lbs.  It was a bit extreme.  "
 In baseball if a play ends and two base runners are at the same base who is safe and who is out? Does the situation change if one of the runners can be forced?.
"We only used Fartlek as a fitness measurement, and as a bit of fun. It does train you, but not as well as a more rounded fitness regime. It is, however, a very good indicator of short term fitness and speed, so is useful as part of your training plan at intervals of a month or two to help you gauge progress. "
"I often see the manager of a winning team making substitutions as the end of  the game nears (sometimes as late as during injury time). The player being replaced is not injured, and doesnt time get added on to make up for the time lost for the substitution to take place?. So, what are the tactics behind this? Is it related to giving the player another cap? (perhaps pay related for an appearance?) Is it a mind-game to try and break up a run of play which may have been in the opponents favour? "
Its a common strategy in most levels of football to call a time out shortly before the ball is snapped prior to a field goal. This is called icing the kicker (as it makes the kicker wait through the time out to kick the field goal) and the idea is to cause the kicker to have to wait longer and either over think about the kick or damage his warmup in some way so he is less prepared to kick the field goal. Does this strategy actually work?.
"Questions about the sport of football, also known as soccer, futbol, association football, etc. Not to be confused with American football which is contained under the [american-football] tag."
"I always thought those substitutions are just used to buy time. The clock doesnt stop during a sub, the player that is substituted never hurries, so it buys some time for the team. The referee has to add the time to overtime, but it will not be the same amount.  "
"Absolutely it is. The middle linebacker has the best vantage point on the defensive field. He also has the best opportunity to look in the quarterbacks eyes to see where he is looking. Armed with this knowledge, as well as watching tape (tons and tons of tape) its expected that the middle linebacker will have more awareness of the field and in the best position to signal his teammates about the upcoming play. The middle linebacker is also in the position requiring the most versatility. They can expect a lot of run up the gut plays, but also have to drop back for pass coverage. They often blitz opposite their front blocker. Because it requires such versatility, you can expect the player you put there to be one of your best jack of all trades types. Because they understand different positions so well, they are also likely to be more aware of the offense as well - theyll be more in the mental aspect of the game than their comrades. "
"This is mostly to encourage more at bats to end with a ball in play. Baseball is most exciting when a batter can put a ball in play. It also gives the batter a slight advantage in that he can continue to foul pitches that he cannot achieve solid contact with and keep himself alive. This balances the pitchers competitive advantage of knowing where the ball is going, how fast its traveling and what kind of pitch is being thrown. In 0 and 1 strike counts the strike on a foul rule exists to advance the count and to speed up the game. Advancing the count in this case serves to add drama and keeps the batter from engaging in a long series of foul offs with no consequence. There are however 3 situations in which a foul ball can result in an out. with 2 strikes any foul bunt attempt will result in a strikeout. with 2 strikes any foul tip that is caught by the catcher will result in a strikeout. in any count a ball that is fouled and caught by a fielder is a foul out. Basically the rule exists to foster more and better competition in the sport. "
"Questions about the American sport of football. Not to be confused with the [football] tag, which Americans call soccer."
"Many people refer to the position as the quarterback of the defense, because the safety needs to recognize formations, and communicate to the rest of the defense accordingly. The safety is usually the last line of defense, and like the middle linebacker, must be versatile. He will have coverage responsibilities, yet must also be prepared to provide run support if a running back or quarterback has gotten past the linebackers. However, the middle linebacker, being close to the line, will often set defensive formations and call audibles to counter tendencies that hes spotted. The safety also perform that function for the defensive secondary, but might be too far away to make adjustments to the seven players in the defensive front. "
 You should try weight lifting on rest days; squats specifically. 
"With beer!  If you thought baseball needed beer to get through a game, you aint never tried curling! Curling is much better with beer!. However, on a more serious note, I would suggest you try playing it.  It is a lot harder and more fun than it looks.  Especially if you like running, slip-sliding, up and down a sheet of ice then you will enjoy curling. Most rinks will have plastic tape that you cover your sliding foot with, and then any average pair of shoes will work, with your uncovered foot acting as a pusher, and your covered foot used for sliding. I suck at it, but it is really a lot of fun trying. Getting the stones to stop in the right place is very hard, but still doable. The sheet level perspective is worth it, if you want to better understand the game. "
"Correct me if im wrong Ive read a little about a wide-nine defensive scheme. Trying to get an understanding of this. From my understanding, a wide nine defensive philosophy depends on defensive ends advancing way beyond the line of scrimmage in order to contain the play between the defensive ends. What disadvantages are there to this scheme / philosophy? What other factors does one have to depend on to make it effective?. "
"In my experience, strength training for distance running has two major benefits: maintain the proper form throughout the run, when not running in proper form, the running efficiency decreases dramatically;  help running uphill and speed up in the last sprint to the finishing line;  For 1, the core training is essential, and you can find quite a few training tutorial at runnersworld.com, they have great videos demonstrating core training from beginning to advanced level, and those all can be done without gym facilities; For 2, workouts that build your overall body strength are enough, like some variations of deadlift as they work on from thighs and calves to back and to shoulder and arms, and sometimes two dumb-bells will do. "
"To me, fartlek is not just fun. As our body is a very adaptive system, if one sticks to a training routine long enough, his body gets used to it, and thus will not make much improvement. So variation is the key (at least to me and itself is fun) so that fartlek can trick the body to keep adapting to different training intensity and condition, thus it can be effective than, but not replace, regular training. "
"Running downhill is more physically demanding, as your body is doing more to resist the force of gravity. Running uphill in itself is not more demanding unless you have a tendency to try to sprint uphill. In fact, if you close your eyes while running uphill, you can easily convince yourself that you are running on a flat plane.   "
They usually participate in huddles with the refs for stuff like the coin toss to decide initial possession and stuff like that - and are generally regarded as one of the better players/leaders of the team. Other than that I suspect its just a glorified title. 
"Often you hear about the team whose ground the match is being played at having a home advantage. During a discussion with a friend they said teams go as far as to style the opposing teams changing room to play mind games; i.e. making the room layout hard for discussion, and the colour scheme being dull so as to lower any motivation. Personally I thought this was a bit too far (sportsmanship anyone?), but I was curious as to what  actually  contributes to a home advantage?.  Additionally, does anyone know of any studies/ statistics which can prove whether the home advantage is merely a myth, or is a real thing?."
"I can think of three key factors that are quite logical conjectures. The crowd is more than likely cheering for them, and cheering against their opponent. It gets very loud on the pitch and very hard to concentrate. For example in American football, the guard often has to signal the center to snap because the center cant hear the quarterback because its so loud. This causes great confusion and miscommunication. The morale aspect is important too. 
 The home team is more familiar with the field. Is this field easier to slip on than most? Is the grass longer?. The environmental factors and familiarity will give you an edge over your opponent, as they need to consciously adjust their style to suit the field, while you, having practiced on this field and played on this field, have a much more natural attunement to it. Lack of travel. Travel is very exhausting, even when you have professional clubs who spare no expense in keeping the players comfortable. You lose a day of preparation traveling as well, but the home team gets that extra day to stay loose and freshen up. If the away team is on the second or third consecutive travel, it can take a pretty heavy toll on their mental and physical state. "
"In cricket, how is it decided from which end to start the match?.  Is this a per-ground convention, a decision of the umpires, or either of the captains? Is each innings necessarily started from the same end?. "
"Although I cant verify this, it could be for balance purposes. I know that in tennis (related sport), when you come into net to hit a volley, good technique states that you should stomp with your (assuming a right-handed player) left foot for a forehand volley and stomp with your right foot for a backhand volley because it helps you mentally and physically hit your shot with a firm wrist and be on balance like you need to be. "
"Ive run a number of races, and there are almost always a number of water stations. I dont usually stop for water on the short races, but Im not sure how long of a race I should do that for - when should I start drinking water?. How much and often should I drink it? "
"To effectively practice any sport, it is not necessary to perfectly simulate an in-game experience. Most forms of practice, after all, are not scrimmages, but drills that improve one or a few skills that may prove useful during a game. Zone defense requires a number of generic defensive skills such as proper footwork, tenacity, one-on-one spacing and, of course, conditioning. Any drill that improves these skills will be helpful in improving a player or teams zone defense. That being said, a team will have to get 5 players on defense at once to really learn how to play zone. And they will have have to face a real 5-person offense to see how a ball and players move and to learn how to react according to the principles of whatever zone defense is installed. Therefore, game-like (5-on-5) simulation is necessary to install an effective zone, and scrimmaging is the reason teams keep more than 10 players on a team at any given time. "
