"I dont know the answer to that. Someone probably does. Im not sure how SciFi would feel about us sucking away some of their top questions, though (The star wars one above has 44 votes, and currently ranks as their 9th-highest voted question)"
"usually migrating questions is avoided if theyre already on-topic for the site.  There really isnt a major point in moving movie questions from sci-fi to here, thatd be  a major hedache"
I just fear that this kind of questions will drown out everything else.
"The problem with having duplicate questions across sites is that it dilutes the expertise.  One of the core goals of the SO model is to have a single authoritative place to find expert-quality answers. By having duplicate questions across sites, that core goal is undermined."
"If the SE model wanted a single authoritative place there wouldnt be so many SE sites.  I find it hard to believe this type of overlap hasnt already been dealt with before.  It sets a bad precedent that even if you searched the site, your question might have been asked on another SE site and will still get closed.  It also means you will spend all day and night linking to existing questions, when Im sure you have better things to do."
"Unsigned: If the two questions didnt already exist on SciFi I would probably agree with you.  IOW, the two questions may well be _more_ on-topic here (although the SciFi community believes theyre on topic there, so who are we to argue?). But since the questions already exist elsewhere, its a disservice to everyone to have identical questions in two places."
"We need to involve SciFi.SE in this discussion, but until the public beta, I dont believe anyone without an account here can view this meta discussion. (Maybe its still worth asking in a SciFi meta question now anyway?)"
"The reason for so many SE sites is for different areas of expertise; not to create duplicate content. And yes, this issue has been dealt with, and to my understanding, the official stand is basically covered in my answer to this question."
"After 6 months, any tags that only have a single instances are clipped. This is great if it gets rid of useless tags, but harmful if it leaves a question without any tags (which results in [tag:untagged])."
"Moving/closing a question does not cause a bad user experience. In fact, the opposite. Having multiple duplicate questions is what causes a bad user experience. Closing as duplicate and merging improve the user experience, by having multiple gateways to the same set of answers."
"Exactly. Though plot fits here as it fits in SciFi, I think, as opposed to what you report regarding the example question, that the real golden questions here (the ones fit for experts) are about directing and acting performances--I think movies are really about the people. And then scenario and effects and all else would be the bread-and-butter. Just my opinion though."
Theyre not considered movies? Is there difference between movie and film? Id definitely consider them film--for me its anything for which the more natural medium is the big screen.
"Never noticed that. Anyways, should be clarified in FAQ. Also it should be made clear, there are the boundaries for that. I saw many questions that could be answered with a link on different SE-sites. So I think that somewhat unclear."
I dont challenge the close. But I think such rules should be clear.
"AND bug listings outdate real quick, AND probably isnt that much of an interesting question anyway. why anyone besides the developer himself (who doesnt know as well) would like a complete assessment of all bugs?"
"Right now, next to the powers that be, were probably the second biggest force that could influence the merge--that is, if we dont frown upon the overlaps, and moreso if we decide to encourage TV high-production series (think HBO)."
"bugs is my mistake, it was a question about all easter eggs."
"Fair enough, but I cant see any way for ordinary members to edit the FAQ."
Refer to Lit and Science Fiction sites to see how it was dealt with there. Seeing that these sites are non-technical it would be best to see what happened there. Dont assume every person knows why subjective questions are frowned upon also.  sir
"The character limit is 26 for tags, I believe.  `acoustic-bass-guitar` isnt too specific if the question is strictly not about electric bass."
"Its 26? I thought it was 20.. my bad. (Also, that still means I counted wrong.)"
"My bad, I blame Gaming.SE for the confusion"
"ChrisS Im not saying Audio shouldnt be merged, just that it shouldnt be merged with us.  I agree that their stats are no good.  Theyll improve with the AVP site."
"Lennart Im not sure I understand.  If the audiences for the Music and AVP sites dont overlap, isnt that a reason to keep them *separate*?  And I dont think recording techniques overlap much with playing techniques, besides obvious things like muddied playing wont result in a clear recording."
"Also, ponder the use of tags. When you have a question about recording a guitar, what tags will you enter? Well, recording guitar of course. This means that on *this* site, filtering out recording questions will be easy. But on an AV site, you would have to also enter the tag music on every musical question, a tag that doesnt come natural when asking a question about recording a guitar. Questions about recording music will therefore be hard to find and follow on an AV site."
"Lennart Oh.  I wouldnt put it so absolutely, but I do agree that Music Recording and Music overlap more than Music Recording and Video Production.  But AVP is **not** just Video.  It will cover Audio Recording, and Music Recording is just a subset of that.  I believe the audience for music-less Audio Recording overlaps with the audience for Music Recording strongly, much more than Music Performance/Practice/Theory overlaps with Music Recording."
Lennart I dont see why the music tag would be necessary.  In the rare cases guitars are recorded for completely non-musical purposes that should be specified in the question.  Music would be the default assumption.
"Matthew: How will people, like me, interested in recording music, find the question if it isnt tagged, on a site where most questions are about completely different things?"
"But *should* it be? This question should have a home somewhere on the SE network, but is that home here?"
"Hmm.  Interesting, I didnt think of it that way.  I am forced to upvote :P"
Lennart It should equal out over time.  This isnt likely to be resolved soon since it looks like the powers that be want to start AVP soon and see how it pans out.
"As a beginner, I find myself not really even *able* to ask nor answer expert questions because I dont know enough about theory or composition or any of the subjects which lend themselves to deeper analysis. Im worried I wont be able to contribute well in the beta. :/"
-1 Using software synths is not on topic on audio.SE so that sort of question would be off topic there.
"Im not super confident in this answer, please feel free to improve it."
What do you mean by reverse engineering?  Transcribing?
"I also dont think it would be an issue, but its way too specific.  Questions are closed as Too Localized when This question would only be relevant to a small geographic area, a specific moment in time, or an extraordinarily narrow situation that is not generally applicable to the worldwide audience of the internet.  I think the last part of that applies here."
Im not _so_ sure. Theres a lot of worldwide figures in music and a specific question could well be a widely wanted nugget of knowledge. Just to throw a thought into it.
"Matthew: it just occurred to me also that the specific example I used in the last paragraphs is just asking to be closed as Too Localised. So I agree, we probably should disallow those questions because of its limited interest. (Unless it is [something like this]"
"Audio Recording should not be merged with this site, or added to this site s scope."
"It s worth trying. A possible trajectory here is that some experts find the beginner questions interesting to answer, and then start asking some of their own. I m the guy who created the original proposal, and I m not an expert."
"First, I have to disagree slightly that the site is solely about making music.  While the title certainly covers making music, theory is explicitly on-topic and should be, because it can inform practice and performance.  While not to the same degree, history also informs practice and performance.  It can also influence composition, which is again on-topic."
"I don t think we should give help on transcribing particular songs, and we certainly should not host transcriptions.  I think help for a particular song is too specific to be useful for the site, and it could definitely run into legal issues. On the other hand, help with transcription in general should be on-topic.  I don t think there s any question that playing by ear would be on-topic, and there s not a clear difference (you can just write down the notes that you ve learned to play by ear!).  You can still get into specifics (e.g.How do I transcribe a guitar masked by lots of cymbals?) without naming the song.  It s probably good to help people learn general transcription skills as well, rather than have them come back for help with every song."
"There are other aspects of reverse-engineering a piece as I understand it than transcribing and they apply both to old and recent compositions, with or without a score.&lt;Understanding/commenting the harmony, themes, form, composition techniques, inspiration sources, related works.In my opinion, this is perfectly acceptable as long you are only making short quotations for works still under copyright. I believe that for classical works this is an important part of music practice and performance. Alas, like Willie Wong suggested, many questions could be viewed as too localized.Discussion of arrangement, ornementation, bass figuration, instrumentation and orchestration used in a recording, a particular form of a work different from available sources."
I personally am not a fan of community wiki questions: they don t count towards and my experience with the SharePoint beta is that wikied answers do not count towards fulfilling your Area51 committments. There are probably a few other badges and counting things that they don t count for as well (my suspicion is that Electorate is similar)
"I think the requirement of the question, a source for which contemporary composers are innovative and which are not, is by it s nature both subjective and argumentative, as any such list would not only be subjective, but create fierce flame-wars. Hence, it is impossible to objectively answer this question; questions of this type are too open ended and usually lead to confrontation and argument. If the question had asked for a source of new contemporary composers, and each person themselves had to then decide if the composer was innovative or not after listening to them, then the question would have been fine. But by requiring that you judge which composers are innovative or not, the question becomes impossible and should therefore be closed."
"Care and repair should definitely be on-topic.  It s closely related to Musical Performance and drawing a line between them would not be useful. I m not as sure about instrument construction.  While there s certainly a large overlap, I would assume the majority of relevant questions are irrelevant to the average musician.  That said, I would have no problem with this site being host to them unless the Musical Instrument Construction, Maintenance, and Repair proposal takes off.  If it does we would presumably migrate our own care  repair questions there as well."
This may be a moot point because the Guitars.SE merge could be happening really soon but I have seen a couple of duplicate questions that we already answered over on guitars on Music.SE already. Is it acceptable to simply redirect the user to the already answered question? How do we handle this scenario?
"Viola and violin are close enough instruments that they can be considered the same for most discussions -- so technically, the violin-family is more accurate than the  tag, but I think the former is inevitably going to fall out of use simply because it s an unwieldy term. Case in point, there are currently 6 questions tagged and 4 tagged violin-family There s also no tag (I tried to start one earlier but I didn t have enough points), and that s likely to become neglected.What should we do? I forgot to mention, the reason I bring up viola is because most questions regarding viola can be answered by violinists, but a lot of violinists likely won t see questions tagged In that sense, a more general term like violin-family could be better."
"The vast majority of copyright infringement goes unchallenged.  The fact that it s illegal doesn t mean people won t do it, whether on the internet or not.  You ve heard of torrent sites, yes? This is not to mention that it depends on your specific area.  It might not be illegal for someone in one country to post a transcription, but it might be illegal for someone elsewhere to do so. If you want this definitively answered, you re going to have to hire a lot of lawyers.  If you d like to look at once piece of related law, see. I can t tell myself under what circumstances that would grant transcription rights, or if it does at all."
"I think we need more rock n roll. The questions so far are often very theoretical, and that s awesome, don t take me wrong. But when the questions are only to and from serious students of music, the target audience is much smaller than if we can get questions for wanna-be rock stars. And the wanna-be rock stars will benefit from questions about musical theory as well, so it s a win-win situation. Unfortunately I have searched my inner teenage rock-star wannabe, but he was buried in incompetence so long ago that I forgot what questions he had."
"After only a few days of public Beta, 85% of the committers have signed up, 50% of followers have signed up and 9% of commitments have been fulfilled. These are good signs but there are less good signs: numbers of new questions is a bit slow questions are leaning a lot toward basic questions that a single wikipedia or google search could solve almost instantly 30% of committers only committed to this proposal so you would expect more dedication and more activity from them. 85% of committers + 50% of followers account for almost 100% of our current about 300 users. So it is time to discuss ways of promoting the site and make it grow and more dynamic."
I still think it s a problem that the site is called &quot;Musical Practice and Performance. I only came to this site via Area 51 because Music Theory was merged into it. But someone coming to this site or hearing about it might not realize its suitability for music theory and that might turn off experts in that area.
"I think this is similar to homework questions on Stack Overflow ? if the asker puts little-to-no effort into the question, it s not helpful and is just a way of getting other people to do your grunt work. That said, if someone has made substantial effort and just needs a little help (ex: analyzing most of the chords in a song but  needing help with just one or two) I think those are fine, especially if people answering can provide helpful tips for how the asker could ve figure it out alone."
" I asked a question a while ago, the bounty on it expired and I sort of forgot about it. I now see that one answer has been awarded a bounty of +25 which I think I did not award. Anyhow, is there anyway to award a bounty now to an answer that was particularly helpful?"
"I ve seen some closings that I consider valid--such as a couple of shopping questions, but I think that the moderators have become a little ambitious towards closing some guitars.   SE questions in an attempt to &quot;avoid the problems on guitars. First off, I m not really sure what that means, so an elaboration on that would be nice--but in particular   if we are to enforce the driving logic behind closing questions like the one linked then all questions related to the specifics of some gear   (guitar electronics, amp design, effects design, pedalboard design, ad nauseum) should be closed as well. I could argue that circuit design on a Stratocaster is electrical   engineering, and consequently belongs on physics.SE, etcetera. The distinction between subject matter inside a broader topic is best handled by tags, not closings. It just so   happens that circuit design and a good bit of eMag are very heavily utilized subject matter when designing and describing amplifiers, electric guitars, and guitar effects.  It s a cross cutting aspect that in my opinion very much belongs here--every bit as much as questions related to repair, general maintenance, and technique."
I expect that we would suppress it as the site no longer exists.
" There will eventually be open moderator elections, and I m sure there will be some Guitars.SE users up for that. I also know that the merge was held up until pro-temp moderators  from music.SE were appointed... I m not sure what the time frame is for the open elections, but if it s going to be significantly far off, perhaps there is some wisdom to   appointing a transitional mod; Chernoff will have to chime in on that one."
"I don t see why not, provided you indicate the sources you ve already searched to save everyone s time including yours."
"Tags aren t created independent of questions.  If a set of good on-topic questions are about music videos, the tag will be added"
"The best way to get new users to our site is through word of mouth. Therefore, if we can reach people who have big mouths, more people will know who we are and why we re awesome.I d like to compile a list of music bloggers and journalists that you all think would be good to expose to this site.This list is not a who can I spam with press releases?type list. Ideally, these people would explore the site, use it a little, and if they like us, do some sort of review / publicity. And hopefully continue to be active users; we re looking for people who are experts in this area AND have some sort of following / klout in the community.I encourage each of you to promote the site whenever you can, to whomever you can - I will not provide a form letter because we at Stack Exchange believe in honest-to-goodness one-on-one interaction.;Although someone posted form letter over on Cooking.SE a long time ago.I think it would be great to have all these bloggers and journalists listed in one place that can be curated collectively and   continually.So...who do you think are good people to contact to help spread the word about music.SE and attract new users?"
"I m not sure there is a way to phrase the question you want to be on-topic, and still get you the answer you want. It sounds like what you want is an open-ended list of things, and those are almost always going to be out of scope on any SE site.I suspect some of the things you want could be found on the TV Tropes site, maybe start with the tropes list for the Bourne series and go from there? To be clear: I m absolutely not saying we aren t willing to help you figure out what questions are on-topic, or how to ask one that is likely to get an answer. But that question is probably not going to be exactly the same one you had in mind when you came here. The fact that you re asking for help phrasing your question means you recognize that the core of it is off-topic; the only way to fix that is to change the question.That new question may well be interesting and useful in its own right; if that s true then you re strongly encouraged to ask it. Just be aware -- it s probably not going to get the answers you were originally looking for"
"For something over a year, I ve been playing my guitar with an alternate tuning I invented, having found myself unable to get anywhere using conventional tuning since my fingers would always brush up against strings they re not supposed to.  Unlike some &quot;novice tunings&quot; which e.g. allow major chords to be played easily but make minor chords just about impossible, or which require ten-fret shifts when going between certain chords, this tuning allows all major, minor, and seventh chords to be played easily within a reasonable range (first nine frets, with the first finger confined to the first six)If anyone s written about or discussed this tuning before, I d like to read about it [hence the question Has anyone encountered G-D-d-f-g-b tuning (guitar)which I hope is on-topic as written].  If nobody s ever written about this tuning before, I m curious what the most appropriate way would be to solicit opinions about it.  I don t wish to be overly vain, but the fact that a novice (myself) could in 48 hours go from not being able to play anything, to being able to play Mermaid Song [Lloyd Weber] and Amazed [Lonestar] would suggest that the tuning does offer some unique advantages which   many people may find useful."
I m glad you linked to this question because the poster mentions Math.SE s reference-request tag.  It s interesting to me that they ve found a way to handle this issue there.
"I would like to ask a related question but I m still trying to learn where the appropriate place for a followup question is. To ask it as a new question would be somewhat redundant. To add it as a comment is not really a question. To add it as an answer is not really answering. (Although the best answers in life are often just better question -another long discussion that I ll avoid!) Ok that said..I have previously voiced my support in Meta for the scope as it currently stands and why it makes music.se unique as-is;I love this community in part because their is no limit in scope as regards genre, bringing me into contact with folks that don t happen to make the same music as. But, since there are no clear deliberations on this site as regards genre, it does bring in one little hiccup regarding lyrics. Lyrics are a greatly important performance-related issue for classical artists who make their art by recreating composer s songs. This also falls over into other genres, known there as singing covers. Focusing for a moment just on classical music, where specific musical performance choices hinge on key insights from text interpretation, what are we to make of questions in that domain here, and how do we keep the scope clear and consistent as the  site attracts more members?"
"I think that we need to add something about asking for resources to the list of off topic flag reasons. It isn t uncommon to see questions asking for drumless tracks, or for a  good sound editor. "
"Any tweak like this is going to take some development effort from StackExchange, and they haven t shown any indication of solving the jTab problems before we get out of beta.posts have already suggested some elegant solutions.I ll note that for single line monospace examples, you can also use backticks. At this point, I don t believe turning off jTab entirely would be a good idea -- we have lots of content that relies upon it, and every instance of it being applied incorrectly has one of the workarounds in place. It sucks, but the learning curve of our code blocks for new users   is not the thing that s keeping us from graduating"
"We have had a lot of sites throughout the history of Stack Exchange that have suffered problems dealing with recommendation questions. That is, questions which are intending to gather a collection of recommended items, from which the author selects their preferred answer out of. Here, this would be questions like the following: I enjoyed  Lucky Number Slevin , what movies out there are like it that I d enjoy? Are there any good Steampunk movies out there? However, these kinds of questions have very poor performance on the sites. This is because their functionality conflicts with the intent of our sites. Our goal is to have expert solutions that are identified by the depth of the knowledge of our users. The accepted answer system is founded on the principle that an answer serves as an  understood closure  to the question. quick notes . To summarize it concisely:They require extensive maintenance (which never happens for long) to be accurate The voting on such lists conflicts with the scope of voting on the site (people vote as if it was a poll, not based on quality)  No single item in the list can  conclude  the question, which conflicts with the nature of Q&amp;A. Many problems result in trying to reduce their scope, due to the subjectivity of how narrow criteria can be. So if any are allowed, generally all are allowed. Compounding on that, the ease and spread of itemized list recommendations gives a very poor image of the site as it does not showcase the expertise that many are looking for.Now, at the moment, there isn t necessarily an intent to invite or allow recommendation questions. Recommendations were in fact noted as off-topic during the definition phase, and there s no trace of them in the top voted on-topic questions. Nevertheless, I m writing this to hopefully get people in the mindset to understand why recommendations are hazardous, and consequently help setup a no-rec policy on the site  before  it opens to public beta. "
What would be the point of a movie QnA if you can t ask questions about the plot of a movie?
"I think that you take it on a case by case basis with the good rule of thumb being it s OK to tag series of movies. I can see Inception being a good tag because it is a movie that generates a lot of discussions, but would we really want a Snakes on a Plane tag? "
"Doesn t this pretty much preclude questions about scifi movies being asked on Movies.SE because almost (if not every) question about a scifi movie is by its very nature Science Fiction? Is Star Wars a movie?  Yes - let me post it on Movies.SE.Oh wait, it s also scifi related... maybe I should post it on SciFi.SE instead? The average person isn t going to agonize over the decision; they re going to post it on the wrong site and have with a lousy user experience when they find out their question has been moved/closed or that there s a battle going on over whether or not they posted it in the right place. Ditto for Literature.SE / SciFi.SE.  Questions about SciFi books are appropriate for both places.  What about Superuser + AskUbuntu/Apple.SE?  Pretty much anything in AskUbuntu is appropriate for Superuser as well as any Mac questions under Apple.SE. IT Security / ServerFault? Statistical Analysis / Mathematics? Theoretical Physics / Physics? Major potential for overlap has been created as StackExchange has been expanding and it s only going to get worse.  If questions are appropriate for multiple sites, then their asking needs to be facilitated. My Solution Why not create some kind of association between overlapping sites where the Questions with similar titles that appear when the title for a question is entered can be expanded to search other sites that will overlap?  This way, if anyone tries to ask a question on SciFi.SE that may already exist on Movies.SE or Literature.SE, they ll appear in the results and hopefully prevent the duplicate from being asked. Edit:  They should appear in general search results too. "
"I think although there will always be ambiguity now and again, the major distinction should be made as to the community of expert each SE caters to. Movies.SE is more about the making of the movie: casting, effects, production, script, scenes. SciFi.SE is more about the universes of Fantasy and Science Fiction: the lore, the reasons behind how or why things are how they are, i.e. the nerdy stuff. Obviously, and especially when the movie comes from a book, the plot/storyline and characters will be the real major overlap, and then it s on-topic of both sites. "
"My question What is done in post-production?  got criticized for not showing any reasearch effort or being general reference. Although it may be valid, I can t find a reference to such a rule and I can t remember ever encounter this on other SE-sites. So I think if these questions should be ruled out, then the FAQ should state this clearly and we should be clear about which questions qualify for this. "
" Can I ask questions about Bollywood (Indian) movies, in private beta? Or is it inappropriate as private beta has few users? "
"The problem I see is if the site becomes popular (which is the goal), then you might be into the same situation as stackoverflow was and you end up needing to split it into multiple sites anyway. "
"I would say that it is not on-topic.  It is a question of business-models, marketing strategy, product management, technology ... very little to do with the content of Movies. Technology does impact Movies - as resolutions go up and new technologies like 3D or all digital filming starts to impact the design of movies this is on-topic - but this cost of the disks is not. "
"I don t think a relaxation of the rep-cap is really needed. At the start of a beta enough mods are looking over the site, so it s time, that users can build up reputation to gain rights. The relaxation on needed reputation to gain privilieges helps, that active participants gain privileges while the site is in beta. So in the midst of Beta the mods can start look over different sites. At the end of beta (including the open beta) enough users will have reached 10K or 20K. "
Probably we should be given an option to have a spoiler checkbox clicked and let the framework append a (SPOILER) in the question. Plus it is not wise to reveal the plot or give away the ending in the  Question. That should be made very sensitive as this forum is going to have a lot of movie watchers and googlers in future! 
"The proposal is marked [status-declined] simply because the site launched and the merge didn t happen. Now, as to whether it should (or shouldn t) happen&hellip; I ll leave that to the experts here to chime in. Closing that Area 51 discussion brings that discussion out of the theoretical (a  proposal ) and into  this  forum, where the actual users charged with the responsibility of  building  this site can discuss it. But I would like to dispel two  weak  reasons to consider a merger: Merge TV or it will never launch.  That s never a good reason in and of itself. Either they re a complementary audience, or they re not. Combining sites only to prop up the numbers is never done. The audiences have to complement each others  interests or you ll never get the network effects  you need to reach critical mass in the subject. Where will TV Theatrical Releases Go?  I m not buying that one either. TV is just one source of story lines for movies. I m sure you can discuss one in the context of the other without worrying too much about crossover. If they are that inseparable, this site will have to include comic books, plays, short stories, books, news events, history, poetry, and stand-up comedians, too. "
"One of the purpose of the reputation cap is keeping a user from earning an  undue  amount of reputation for a single, popular contribution. It s a throttling mechanism to keep a balance between on-going contribution and popularity. If anything,  the reputation cap is needed  more  during the private beta.  There are far fewer post and everyone is concentrating (and voting) on what little there is to vote on. So, certainly there is an undue (or at least a  disproportionate ) amount of rep being doled out during the private beta."
"It would be nearly impossible to keep the scope of all SE sites mutually exclusive, and SciFi and Literature are clearly sites which overlap with us. This issue is seen across SE. Partially it comes down to personal preference. You might feel more comfortable in one site or another.  SciFi is a more established site, has a great community of followers so undoubtedly there are going to be questions there that would also be suitable here, but that is the site they are happiest posting in. You might also prefer a perspective of a movie goer or sci-fi addict, so would choose one site or another. For instance you are probably going to get more responses from SciFi if the question is about underlying SciFi themes or ideas, or links to the book that a movie is adapted from (though this is also often covered here). Here the perspective is going to be more about the movie, even if there is prior media such as books or comics. It is generally discouraged to migrate questions between sites purely to try to get them into the (subjective) best site. If it is on-topic for the site it is generally left there.  The SciFi mods are aware of us, and do migrate questions that clearly would be better handled here, such as a lack of SciFi content to the question. "
"I would agree if the unregistered user has not visited the site for a month, and the question is unanswered - or if requests for more detail have been made via comments and are being ignored."
"One needs to answer,  What is so different about them that would warrant exclusion ? My answer is  Nothing . If it feels like dirtying the site, there aren t too many the anyways, as you mention. I just don t know if it s worth mentioning in the FAQ though. "
"I would say that as long as they are professionally produced there shouldn t be made a difference between TV and web series (or movies) on this site. It is very likely that the borders between television and the internet will blur in the upcoming years, so eventually it will probably become impossible to exclude web stuff anyway. The threshold of originality and professionality should be more important than the way of distribution, if you ask me. We should just make sure we don t end up getting questions about every youtube videblog out there.TLDR: Allow them as long as they are produced above amateur level.  "
"While the badges are not unobtainable, they are definitely harder in a beta site due to the reduced traffic compared to a graduated site. I can only assume there are not reduced badge constraints because they don t want to make it too  easy  to get a badge like  Legendary  or of the same sort. The purpose behind the badges is a way to encourage users to stick around and contribute more to the site. "
"The badges are set up the same on every site.  For consistancy and to allow the badges to have roughly the same meaning across the network they are for the same value on all of the sites.  It wouldn t make sense consistancy wise to allow beta sites to get more gold badges than a site that s been around a lot longer. It d also be a logistical nightmare.  Let s say we were to lower the bar on gold badges on a beta site.  What happens if/when the site graduates?  Do those who have gold badges lose them?  Do they keep them?  Again, it s easier to just have one standard network wide. "
"I believe that there is merit in keeping identification questions, but as a community we need to be consistant in the enforement of quality of these questions.  We need to come up with a set of rules that identification questions are required to meet. For example, perhaps you shoudd be able to answer these: What When Where How Examples of how these could be answered: What: a sci-fi horror movie in space When: Mid 70 s Where: in the united states How: the movie threatre, it was a new release I m oversimplifying, but I believe that you should be able to extract text from an identification question that answers those questions.  Wihtout answers to these simple questions, it s a lot harder to figure out what a person is talking about. "
"I think that they are not great questions, but in theory someone might have an interview with a writer or producer on the show who addresses such things - so getting past the initial impression about the triviality of the question, there is no sound reason why we should not take it at face value.That said, I had already exercised my right as a user to downvote one of them as I thought it was unlikely to be a great question - unfortunately 11 people disagree with me.

I don t think they deserve to be fully closed, but down-voted, I can see. Just my $0.02 "
I know doing a topic of the week has been discussed before. What I m suggesting is that even with out a reward we just start a topic of the week to generate more questions on this site during Beta. I also think that a general topic will generate more questions. Such as Classic TV Sitcoms would generate more questions then Sanford &amp; Son. So should we go ahead and start a topic of the week?   
"I think that as long as we can build a list of topics that is long enough that we can be confident that the idea will not just die off, then I think that would be a good idea. If this question gets enough support, then we could open another community-wiki question to collate and order the list of topics. I think that people should upvote / downvote your question to register support or not. (also if people have points to make, other answers would also be welcome). "
"The question is a bit vague, and could be answered by presumably a whole slew of techniques - but I didn t have much of a problem with it.  What techniques do they use to make someone thinner, more muscular, bigger etc..... I can see that as a useful question. 
 I don t see it in the same category as a general reference such as material that can be trivially found out about an actor or a movie on IMDB or Wikipedia. I struggled with the stunt question too, particularly: How is it decided whether to use a stunt in a scene? Are there official rules for that? To my initial reading this seemed rather a non question - if the script calls for a dangerous thing to be performed - isn t this automatically a stunt? Other questions like this have cropped up with a  is there a rule for that  which seems a little naive to me. However on reading the answer I reappraised the question as perhaps asking how do they decide what sort of stunts are performed, who performs them, or how much CGI is used instead to mitigate cost or danger.  The question could do with editing to clarify this point perhaps. So, to sum up - I don t think they are closable, but perhaps people should be more willing to use downvotes or to suggest edits if they think they are not good questions. "
"I remember the old review had a section close to the bottom that let you know badge status, but with the new review section this seems to be gone.

"In my opinion Bollywood is a part of  indian-movies , so I think  indian-movies  should be a master tag and  bollywood  should be its synonym. Similarly  Kollywood  should be synonym of  indian-movies . At current   indian-movies  is a synonym of  bollywood  which is wrong and should be reversed. But Community discussion is needed for it. Not only Bollywood, there are Tollywood,  Sandalwood in India. There are so many regional languages, so there are so many movie industries. "
 I don t see the point of tag synonyms. I see bond for james-bond and nolan for Christopher-nolan. Wouldn t it make more sense to have a mod approve tags? We can even have people with enough rep do that by retagging. Just a thought.  
"On a site as small as this, you  could  have a moderator approve all tags.  It would require co-ordination, and a governing tagging  scheme  but there are only 3 moderators on this beta site.  This would start to break down if the number of people grew (more moderators or people with enough reputation). On a larger site like StackOverflow or Super-User, with many more moderators this co-ordination would be unwieldy and I could see it breaking down.The tagging mechanism (whilst not ideal) is a way of dealing with tagging without having to have significant co-ordination with other people. Unfortunately we have to share the same platform with other sites that are significantly larger than we are.   "
It is the current practice to tag films independently. If you enter the tags area and search with the strings -2 or -3 you will see examples of films released this way. Generally films in the Star Wars and Harry Potter franchises have distinctive titles. Synonyms are not the best way here. 
"Most tags and questions on our site only contain titles of movies/series, without IMDB links. Wouldn t it be more useful for visitors to have an IMDB link to visit? In my opinion, it would enrich the look and feel of our site and add some more clarity to questions (especially with for remakes and older movies). (Please note that I am not trying to promote IMDB but we might as well use their extensive database) "
"I m against what s on Netflix, because it s like What s on TV tonight? There d be nothing wrong with either of those questions in an ephemeral forum, and maybe StackExchange wants to do that. But if we re carrying over from the technical side, what makes StackOverflow so useful is that someone else far in the future will Google a similar question and find an answer. So, Is it raining today? doesn t fit that. Questions  about  IMDB I think can be useful?I was gonna come down on the Yeah, let  em in! side?but they really belong in meta. I use IMDB all the time to look up stuff about movies, and it has its own quirks and tricks, but these are not questions about  movies  but about  finding movies  or  learning about movies . Very meta. Netflix I don t think has any meta value. It s awful for finding out about movies. "
"On one side we have especially in sci-fi futuristic equipment which are explained by handwavium and unobtainium. Scripts completely ignoring realism because the authors did not research anything or prefering inaccurate, but cool gizmos. In these cases it seems lost time to answer equipment questions for things that do not exist or work. On the other hand, we have many situations where movies must portrait equipment details realistically to hold the suspension of disbelief. Or the author wanted to make a realistic movie. Or the genre itself demands to portrait the use of equipment and gadgetry (heist movies). Some films are also a nod to some fields which know at once what the presented equipment means but is inscrutable for other people.Is it allowed to ask what realistically portrayed things are and how they are used? Examples:I saw in a movie how they breached the safe with a strange glowing rod? What was that? Answer: It was a thermic lance. In the movie they attempted the drive the rich woman crazy by gaslighting. But who was the translucent woman? Was she really getting crazy in the end?

" I am aware that in .NET there are three timer types (see Comparing the Timer Classes in the .NET Framework Class Library ). I have chosen a threaded timer as the other types can drift if the main thread is busy, and I need this to be reliable. 
 The way this timer works in the control of the timer is put on another thread so it can always tick along with the work begin completed on the parent thread when it is not busy. 
 The issue with this timer in a console application is that while the timer is ticking along on another thread the main thread is not doing anything so the application closes. 
 I tried adding a  while true  loop, but then the main thread is too busy when the timer does go off. "

 A more direct answer would be to write general files that they would include_once into their file that would provide the usability they would need. This would be broken up into categories and NOT provided in one MASSIVE hooks.php file. Be careful though, because what ends up happening is that files that they include end up having more and more dependencies and functionality improves. Try to keep API dependencies low.

" Ive been using TortoiseSVN  in a Windows environment for quite some time.  It seems very feature-complete and nicely integrated into the Windows shell, and more importantly, its fairly painless to teach to colleagues with little or no experience with source control.   However , since we have moved to Windows Vista 64bit, Tortoise has been very buggy and has seemed to cause lots of explorer.exe abnormalities and crashes.  This has happened both with older versions of the software and the latest version (1.5.1 build 13563). 
 I was curious if anyone has suggestions for other Subversion clients that will run on Windows (specifically Vista 64bit).  Developers here use a variety of text editors so using Visual Studio or Dreamweaver for SVN is not ideal. 
 I have heard great things about Cornerstone, and would love something similar for Windows if it exists. 
 Im correlating the Vista/explorer problems with Tortoise because they normally occur when Im using the functionality in Tortoise.  Sometimes bringing up the merge screen will cause the GUI to start acting very strange and eventually hang or crash. 
 I did not see 1.5.2 -- Im installing now, maybe that will fix some of my issues. "
 I have been using the 64Bit version of TortoiseSVN for ages and I have never had issues with it on Windows 64Bit or Vista 64Bit. I am currently not aware of any other similiar SVN clients that do work on Vista. Is it possible the problem could lie within the configuration of TortoiseSVN or even the installation of Vista? Is the problem occurring on Vista native or SP 1? 
" I too get explorer crashes in Vista (Im not in the 64Bit version though). Im using Vista Super Saijen (or whatever they are calling the most expensive version). Im not having any bugs with Tortoise. 
 My explorer does, however, crash about every other day (sometimes multiple times a day if its having an off day). Im not positive its being caused by TortoiseSVN though. From what I hear, the explorer just crashes a lot in Vista... 
 Have you tried uninstalling Tortoise and using Windows for a day or two and seeing if it still crashes? Do you restart your computer at least once a day (It seems the longer I go between restarts, the worse the crashes get)? "
" Ive been banging my head against  SQL Server 2005  trying to get a lot of data out.  Ive been given a database with nearly 300 tables in it and I need to turn this into a MySQL database.  My first call was to use bcp but unfortunately it doesnt produce valid CSV - strings arent encapsulated, so you cant deal with any row that has a string with a comma in it (or whatever you use as a delimiter) and I would still have to hand write all of the create table statements, as obviously CSV doesnt tell you anything about the data types. 
 What would be better is if there was some tool that could connect to both SQL Server and MySQL, then do a copy. You lose views, stored procedures, trigger, etc, but it isnt hard to copy a table that only uses base types from one DB to another... is it? 
 Does anybody know of such a tool?  I dont mind how many assumptions it makes or what simplifications occur, as long as it supports integer, float, datetime and string. I have to do a lot of pruning, normalising, etc. anyway so I dont care about keeping keys, relationships or anything like that, but I need the initial set of data in fast! "
" I have a pretty standard table set-up in a current application using the .NET XSD  DataSet  and  TableAdapter  features. My  contracts  table consists of some standard contract information, with a column for the  primary department . This column is a foreign key to my  Departments  table, where I store the basic  department name ,  id ,  notes . This is all setup and functioning in my SQL Server. 
 When I use the XSD tool, I can drag both tables in at once and it auto detects/creates the foreign key I have between these two tables. This works great when Im on my main page and am viewing contract data. 
 However, when I go to my administrative page to modify the department data. I typically do something like this: 
  Dim dtDepartment As New DepartmentDataTable()
Dim taDepartment As New DepartmentTableAdapter()
taDepartment.Fill(dtDepartment)
 However, at this point an exception is thrown saying to the effect that there is a foreign key reference broken here, Im guessing since I dont have the  Contract   DataTable  filled.  
 How can I fix this problem? I know I can simply remove the foreign key from the XSD to make things work fine, but having the additional integrity check there and having the XSD schema match the SQL schema in the database is nice. "
" Rolling your own PHP solution will certainly work though Im not sure if there is a good way to automatically duplicate the schema from one DB to the other (maybe this was your question). 
 If you are just copying data, and/or you need custom code anyway to convert between modified schemas between the two DBs, I would recommend using PHP 5.2+ and the PDO libraries.  Youll be able to connect using PDO ODBC (and use MSSQL drivers).  I had a lot of problems getting large text fields and multi-byte characters from MSSQL into PHP using other libraries. "

"Casebash Sorry, I got a little ahead of myself. The question _could_ speak to policy, which is tightly coupled to economics across the board. I dont think we can separate the two. Once he edits the question I think it would be a better example for discussion. A purely economic related question, like .. will Social Security go bankrupt? would be out.

"I dont think theres a clique on Skeptics, I might have not been very confident in asking my first question there, but it was quite well received. I get that we dont want to set the bar too high, but at the same time a naturally controversial subject like politics will be unmanageable if we set the bar too low. In any case, theres no urgency in this, were still in private beta, this discussion can (and probably will) carry on for a while. I think it will be a lot easier to come up with a balanced policy when we get to public beta and get a better idea of what questions the site attracts."
"In which case, maybe we should target the proper political name of the countries especially as that at present political history is on-topic here, and historically speaking, United States does not purely represent the ones in America - ."
I agree that the requirements on skeptics are too high. You are for example not even allowed to use basic logic to argue or prove something. You *have* to have a reliable source that says what you say. I dont think we need to have that requirement here.

Im just saying it eliminates what I think are the really interesting questions. Another example is what would happen if we eliminated the electoral college - what would happen? We dont know because campaigns would significantly change and experiment to see what was effective."
"KevinPeno Chat is indeed already up and running, but hopefully will become far more active when were out of private beta was what I meant :)"

"Whether they are list-type questions I dont know, but I also think that questions on advantages/disadvantages are suitable questions. One may *objectively* research what arguments are commonly cited; [example on climate change skepticism]Therefore I think those should be fine."
"My point (my answer) is: There is **no way** to avoid opinions on these questions. This isn?t just hypothetical, I see that every day on other sites."
"I agree 100% on judge people by their actions rather than their beliefs. On political leaning being private - in general Id agree, but in any society there are positions that carry extra burdens to ensure that the privileges they also carry arent abused, and those are often in the service of transparency in government. Judges, for example, are usually expected to disclose potential conflicts of interest, and where necessary recuse themselves."

"
Now, the subjectivity required differs depending on the subject being discussed. Many of the examples you cited as open ended can be answered in a neutral fashion by citing the general accepted advantages/disadvantages of these policies. For example, I can imagine someone studying politics being asked these questions (What are the disadvantages of first-past-the-post electoral systems?) in a short answer format where they are expected to just list certain, generally accepted advantages/disadvantages. Most of these questions can be answered reasonably objectively by stating that in situation X (say two similar candidates), result Y likely occurs (vote splitting) and this result is generally considered undesirable. Most of the debate comes from which is better, as people argue about the importance of each of the factors, how likely these situations are, ect. So these questions can be answered well by this site. Additionally, disallowing these questions would be too restrictive as most of the remaining questions could be answered by Wikipedia, giving people no reason to come here. Therefore I vote in favour of the questions you have listed. I do agree that questions that are too open ended will be one of our biggest problems, just not the examples you have listed."
"I think we should allow questions on campaigning. For questions that are opaquely seeking campaign advice, we should probably worry more about the question being too localized. I think many campaign advice questions will be caught by the normal rules of a SE website, but I think the main thing to be on the lookout for in questions seeking campaign advice is if they are a what should I do? question. Of course, that exact wording would be rare, but it cant be difficult to identify which questions are saying as much in different words. Politics.SE should aim to be descriptive, rather than prescriptive, and those questions call for the exact opposite of that. Im a bit hesitant to give a strict list of criterion, because I dont want to over-correct for an as-of-yet non-existent problem. I havent really participated much in the meta of any given SE site before, so Im not really sure how communities normally deal with these sorts of issues.  "
"If we cant talk about the advantages and disadvantages of different policies we risk this site merely becoming an encyclopedia or dictionary. Most policies have a reasonably sized list of generally agreed upon advantages and disadvantages. List questions are more like: What countries have implemented these policies? or What is a good change to the budget to save money?. These questions have an almost endless supply of answers, and its hard to answer them in a way to do them justice. 
"
"I say this is very uh, shall we say shaky ground: Flame wars. One political parties advantage is another?s disadvantage. What if parties get into it? Cue lots of debate, which could end up being an issue. List questions. The advantages and disadvantages are very subjective, for a number of reasons, including the ones I listed above. For example, certain policies - I can list advantages and disadvantages. For example, with this question: Mandatory voting laws cause many things: Disadvantage: Because they have to vote anyway, why bother doing any research on the candidates?. Advantage: For some parties, having a ignorant populace works in their favor. uninformed just didnt sound right. (I could go more in-depth, but lets not turn this into a answer on that topic right now). Now, thats the first thing that popped into my head. 3 others agree with me, so Id like them to voice their opinions as well.  "
"I have to agree with jrg that this is shaky ground.  If we put in the FAQ that answers should be nonpartisan and if we enforced that, we could keep this under control. Another possibility is that we could require disclaimers for answers that are noticeably partisan, like how on other SE sites how it is required/strongly recommended that people who promote their own products state that they are the producer of that product. Overall, following one of these rules will get us better answers overall, but following the second will lead to more of a discussion-style where there could end up being 2 best answers that only differ in partisan perspective, and the accepted answer being what the original poster agrees with, not necessarily the best answer. Therefore, I propose that we aim for my first suggestion, but we can always use the second as a fallback. "
"I think these can be permitted to the extent that pure speculation doesnt become the only basis of answers the question can receive. At that point were holding hypothetical discussions, not answering questions. What we cant do is entertain questions about sensitive issues wrapped in the context of politics. A question about the effects of fracking is not a political question, its an environmental question. Similarly, you cant ask about boat maintenance in the context of being a programmer on Stack Overflow. If someone is questioning the position of a political candidate when it comes to a certain issue, Skeptics may be the best place to ask. A question about bad science that a political candidate is pushing isnt mainly about politics, its about bad science, unless that bad science is  political  science. I think we should limit our scope to questions where the history, studies or established knowledge  of politics  can be the foundation for answers that a question could receive. The potential effects of policies can and (I believe) broadly do fall into this category, provided that they are asked in a neutral way. Context, of course, is king when it comes to determining the topic and objectiveness of individual questions for now.  "
"If nothing that has been tried has worked, how can we know what the best way is? Questions that arent 100% fact-oriented arent necessarily bad, but you should be able to look at a list of answers and say that ones probably right. I could post the answer I think that requiring donations in multiples of $7 would decrease corruption, and theres nothing that makes my answer right or wrong. A better way to interpret your question might be What methods have been tried to reduce the corruption that comes with fundraising? How much success have they had?. Now its asking about stuff thats actually been tried, not whatever random untested theory the reader happens to come up with off the top of their head. "
"In this question, there are presently two answers. In short, one says  yes , one says  no , and I cant really say which one is more correct: Does the head-of-state pardon violate separation of powers?. Is this situation, how should I decide what question to accept, if any?. "
"Sometimes there is not a correct answer, or at minimum it isnt black and white. Id agree that marking either answer as accepted puts a bias on the questioner and perhaps even the site. Its questions and answers like these that make me feel that all answers should contain references to studies or original sources pertaining to the question, such as the reference to  the Federalist Papers in one answer (that wasnt technically included to make the point). "
"So Ill chime in too an I would nominate myself too. My experience  
Im a full blown community organiser, while not that active on other SE sites due mostly to a lack of interest in the topics I do organise local groups and events on a regular basis including moderation of forums and mailing-lists. I study Information Systems and am strongly in favor of a scientific debate that should not be ruled by who shouts the loudest. On the meta-side of SE I do tend to lurk as I do see a lot of good proposals which I then upvote but I tend to only interfere if I dont agree on a certain topic. My intentions  Im a student with a political background, I have time to spare and I would really like to see politics.SE take off. We need a neutral platform to discuss political issues. Should I become an appointed moderator pro tempore I would do mostly janitorial work, enforce the rules as per meta and doing what Im already doing (due to my reputation) like approving suggested edits. I would also be working on tag-synonyms as by decision of the community. Furthermore would I try to enforce a strict neutrality and in cases where there are doubts clarify them on meta. "

"I think the Islam scuffle is a pretty good illustration of why  this is a bad idea. To be fair, Im quite happy with the moderators there so far - but because they got stuck right away with the label of  Sunni  Mods, theyve had to put up with a lot more drama than they really should have. There are far more potential political affiliations than there are moderator positions. So someones gonna feel left out no matter what.  More importantly , the first moderators on the site will be chosen by some of us working for SE, and were  far  more interested in things like past experience and the ability to help others while remaining calm and professional... So theres a very good chance that the initial moderation team wont represent a balanced cross-section of various political views, since well tend to look for folks who  dont  inject their personal politics into  every single discussion. Which brings me to the best reason for just ignoring this entirely: regardless of what a given moderators views are on a topic, hell be expected to act fairly toward those who disagree with him and with whom he disagrees, regardless of the topic. If youre forced to wear your politics on your shirt sleeve (like... some sort of colored arm band), then youre just  inviting  discord and harassment where none would otherwise need to exist. Not a good start to the site. Wanna know what a particular person is like? Read what theyve written. Is it accurate, informative, and  helpful?  Or does it push a particular point of view to the detriment of all else? A moderator team full of the latter, no matter how balanced, is not going to do well.  "
"We should consider what someone will do with information that they walk away with after visiting our site. Ill venture to say that a significant number of users will be looking for evidence to support or discredit an argument. 
Sure, all of the needed references could be found in Wikipedia and other resources, but thats not a well crafted answer that speaks directly to the question ending in a well informed conclusion. 
I dont think just the facts can be enforced unilaterally for all questions, but it should be  strongly  encouraged. Additionally, the probability of a question receiving such an answer seems to be a good consideration when determining if a question is on the bad subjective end of the spectrum. 
I dont think weve seen enough questions to decide one way or the other at this point. However, I hope that answers serve a greater purpose than just reinforcing someones opinion after learning that someone else agrees with them. This may not  always  be possible, but the majority of answers should be able to be validated to varying degrees. "

A lot of political questions dont have squat to back them up. How did Khrushchev end up in charge after Stalin died? Ive read a number of books on that period and none of them has anything more than wild guesses. Lots of interesting possibilities. Or take one of the biggest questions in U.S. politics right now - should we have a balanced budget with no debt. No industrialized country has ever had a balanced budget. So there is nothing to back up answers on either side of the questions. If you require a back it up rule, then questions like this are not allowed. And yet many of the most interesting questions fall in this category. "
We should neither encourage nor discourage either; both are fine. 
"Im reluctantly coming down on the side of a back it up rule as well. 
While at first I both hoped it would be unnecessary and thought it posed the risk of politics.se becoming as uptight as skeptics.se (dont get me wrong, I like Skeptics a lot - I just dont think we need to be  quite  that strict), I now think its clear that we do need to police overtly opinionated answers. Oh, yeah ... to answer the actual question: Im trying  real hard  not to let my own opinions influence my voting, and I think Im pretty much succeeding. Its painful sometimes to downvote an opinionated Q or A that I agree with, but so far Im battling through it ;-). Im also making a point of walking away from the computer for a few minutes before downvoting an opinionated Q or A that I strongly disagree with, then coming back to see whether I still think the downvote is justified per the rules of the site ... which seems to help. "
"I would say that moderators should be able to show their edit history, and convince anyone that they are indeed impartial. To put it pithily (I hope): 
To be a good moderator, you have to show people who are clear partisans your edits (blind, without knowing the candidate) and those people should NOT be able to tell your political leanings from edits alone.  Matter of fact, I think this should be - if technically feasible - a required step in moderator elections on a site like this. A good example of neutral mods would be History.SE - I can not, for the life of me, figure out their political leanings. "
These are not good questions on SE. Most questions should have a right answer. These are both list questions and subject to quite a bit of Bad Subjective opinion. That said questions like What is the partys official position on the topic of and what are their arguments for against such a policy? would be a good question. Even a question that contrasts 2 or 3 parties position could be OK so long as is it asking for  a constructive explanation  of the topic and positions taken by others  not a subjective opinion  its good and bad points. 
"This question is two-part: 1) What is a good META.politics.SE tag to use on questions which deal with content that can be described as points of view from one side of political debate? E.g. what do the conservative thinkers say on the topic of X? . 2) What is a good tag for the main site (either the same tag or different one) to label questions which deal with points of view from one side of political debate?. Please note that Im not asking about relative quality or welcomeness of discussing such things in posts, merely a good tag to label them once they are asked. "
"One of the things that greatly irks me in political discussions (including answers on Politics.SE) is the habit of people to state something like: X side of political spectrum is for Y, and the other side is against Y - with no rigorous definition or what being for Y means, nor ANY evidence to back the claim up. A typical example (on Politics.SE but quoted from Wikipedia) is the classic  left wing is for the Working class, right wing is for the wealthy . Notice the problems (if you are being objective): Your statement is impossible to either prove or falsify, due to lack of precision. How do you define working class?  Do I as a software developer work? Do only people performing physical labor work? (and does standing around the conveyor belt watching robots assembling cars considered physical labor? Does sitting in a cabin of a subway train pushing buttons count? Does it all over a sudden make me a worker if Im a sysadmin and have to carry around servers once in a while? Do surgeons count? Do unemployed count - which according to Wikipedia some people include in working class. Do unemployed bankers count?)  What is left wing?  Do you include the Greens, who severely hurt workers in logging, coal and other energy industries? Do you include illegal immigration advocates, whose policies are generally considered left wing, but are a lot more supportive of wealthy employers who want cheap illegal labour, than poor workers whose face competition from that cheap labour?  (yes, I know, thats a controversial statement. Im using it as an example of a nuance, not as absolute truth). What do you mean being for working class? There are well founded arguments that the poor on average - in  absolute  way - live a significantly better life in USA than USSR. Are the union people who helped run Hostess into the ground for the poor who now have 15,000 jobs less for them?  (again, this is an example, not an invitation to discuss if it was more the fault of the union, management, or healthy eating advocates that drove Hostess into the ground). If a policy benefits the wealthy short term at the expense of the poor, BUT benefits the poor long term, are you for the wealthy or for the poor? Most importantly, even if you define working class and left and even. being for precisely,  what is your proof that left wing satisfies these definitions and right wing does not ???. Did you include a well executed poll among what you defined as right wing that shows their preference to hurt the working class? Or statements from political leaders of right wing that claim they are against working class?. Or the opposite, do you have any proof that policies officially advocated (with proof) by what you defined as left wing demonstrably benefit working class? With proof that they are the cause of benefit (as opposed to correlation)? With proof that the policy is sustainable?. In other words, you can probably argue solidly that taking 100% of net worth from individuals whose net worth is >$1mm and evenly dividing them between those with. Did you present (or at least hint at) the proof that the policies advocated by however you defined right wing hurt the poor long term, with causation chain? Have you made a clear distinction between hurt the poor and increase the wealth disparity?. My question is, how do we as a community feel about such vague unsupported claims presented as facts in answers?. Do we prohibit them and strong encourage to downvote any answer which relies on such a claim?. 

Do we not care? "
"If the question is about a specific argument made by specific people then I think a well referenced answer could be made.  I think good answers could also come asking for what political experts have written on the topic. But if the question is general or generic views then there is no way to address the issue here that would be considered constructive.  There are many opinions and quite frankly the issues we actually face are so complex that it is impossible to address them here.  Those types of questions are better suited for discussion forums, or as the subject of research papers and blog postings.
If after some point we begin to have a politics SE Blog I can see something like that being the subject of a post there.  But questions should be around the facts not the opinions. "
"If there are political opinions/bias in an otherwise good and neutral/factual answer, how do we as a site want to handle it?. As a hypothetical, someone asks a question on presidential elections.  The answer directly addresses the question, but there are some comments within the question like  But people voted for Obama anyways because they wanted free stuff  or  Romney lost because he was an inhuman robo-man. How should we handle opinions injected into factual answers?  My personal inclination is to just edit them out, but Im hoping to get an consensus on meta so that Im not seen by anyone to be acting alone or being biased. "
"Your question is fully approproate IMHO, but I must admit that I dont see what the actual problem is with existing solutions. We already have a mechanism for dealing with subjective or bad questions. Downvotes and close votes. Also,  dont forget editing . A posted question may have subjective/incendiary wording, but underneath it all contain a legitimate answerable on-topic question. That even beats downvoting and closing. As usual, we dont have to be  rude  about it. Dont just close as not constructive, explain politely WHY it is not constructive (can not be answered objectively, yadda yadaa template), and provide constructive suggestion on how to improve to get the question to become more acceptable (or as per above, just edit it yourself). If someone has issues with our community rules, tough luck, sorry. We are not here to be social services, psychological support hotline, or comforters. We are here to answer questions that  can  be answered. As long as we are being civil about it, likely to cause further hurt should not be a reason to either wave SE rules, OR to institute special censorship. If they want to  discuss  things subjectively, or vent their feelings, they can go to politics.SE chat instead. Or any of countless thousands other discussion forums available. Again, I dont see any need to ban any topics. "
"I recently read an answer that answered the question asked, but also included a couple paragraphs of the authors opinions on environmental policies. These, while related to the topic of the question, did not directly serve to answer it. I submitted a suggested edit to remove these paragraphs. Was this acceptable? I think moderators are supposed to do things like this, but I also know that edits are not supposed to subvert the authorial intent of the original post. "
" 

Where do we draw the line as to what kinds of legal questions are on topic? Can people ask whether they have to submit to a search? Whether their landlord can evict them? If a security guard can arrest them? These dont seem to have any relationship to politics at all If we allow these questions for beta, are we really going to throw them out when we graduate? Remember that this could be one or more years away. Its a really bad idea to host questions until the right site is started. Firstly answering those questions here will decrease the effort to get a real legal questions site started. Secondly, when it is, many people will have got used to the idea that this is the place to come for legal questions. So that takes away from the legal site. 
 "
"After reaching public beta, I see more and more disputable questions such as: why a rational person would .  what are the rational arguments against .... 
 why people think that .... This are, in my opinion, not constructive questions because the author thinks his ideas are right and the other people are wrong, and is asking why anyone thinks other than him/her. The why-people-think-so questions, BTW, belong rather to sociology/psychology SE, not politics SE. How to deal with such questions? Should we suggest the author to change the question because this is not the site for political disputes? Or simple flag and downvote them, and the authors should either stop or learn what is wrong with those questions?. "
"You are referring the English wikipedia only. But in such matters as history or politics, just make the effort of visiting the same page in other languages, and you could be surprised how different they can be. Wikipedia shouldnt be trusted when it comes to such themes as history and politics. And its not the Wikipedia, but Wikipedias. Just take such topic as Kosovo or Arab Spring. The English-speaking sites and Russian-speaking sites describe it as it they were living in two separate worlds. This site should encourage deeper studies, and not just referring to Wikipedia. "
"On some SE sites, having a tag wiki be a copy/paste from Wikipedia article is frowned upon (e.g. on SciFi&amp;Fantasy its a semi-official policy, acknowledged by moderators, that such tag wiki edits are to be rejected and fixed). This is NOT for IP reasons, e.g. this is against the rules even if the fact of copy/pasting from Wiki is openly attributed to satisfy copyright. 
Should we have the same policy here? The problem with such policy is that for some tags - especially technical terms from political science - the Wiki summary just might be the clearest, most accurate wording possible. Rejecting it seems merely inviting inferior wording for no good reason. Just to be clear, the question is about  100% prohibiting  - as a policy - Wiki paragraph quoting in lieu of writing your own text. It has nothing to do with encouraging writing your own wording, especially in cases where the tag does not 100% match the Wiki term, or where Wiki wording isnt ideal. It has nothing to do with discouraging copy/pasting Wiki paragraphs that arent a good fit for questions that the tag covers.

"Ive asked this in the comments to, to no avail. There are upvotes and downvotes on the question, currently balancing at -2, and there are positive and negative comments. The only close reason given by Robert Cartaino was: Its not likely someone could reasonably answer whether smaller countries are actually governed better than larger ones without a lot of discussion and debate around the talking points. whereas I do think that such questions are very appropriate in Political Science. I do think that such a question can be answered objectively by looking at appropriate statistics. Is this question salvageable? How?."
"Agreed, the answer is tangentially related commentary that doesnt even come close to an attempt to answer your question. I flagged it as well and upvoted your comment, its a good enough explanation of why the answer doesnt really stand as an answer. I cant (obviously) know why your flag was declined, but I must admit that I had to read both your question and the answer twice to be absolutely certain its not an answer. Ive added a link to this Meta discussion in my flag, Im assuming that if it gets declined again, well get a full explanation about it here. "
"If you do not know where you come from, then you dont know where you are, and if you dont know where you are, then you dont know where youre going. And if you dont know where youre going, youre probably going wrong.

"Its caching, its always caching ;). The view count isnt as important or as likely to change rapidly as the vote count and its cached more aggressively. "
"You can safely assume that the user requested for their account to be removed, moderators (that we dont have yet) and SE employees wouldnt remove an account without the user asking for it, with the exception of obvious spam accounts. Im not so sure what more information you are looking for, but Im afraid this is all that youll get, theres absolutely no reason for specifics to be discussed publicly. "
Politics shouldnt change a thing because any new site is created. Its up to the new site to determine their scope and what is acceptable and if the current politics definition cover all or almost all of their scope thats their problem. Besides I would expect vastly different answers to a question about basic income on an Economics.SE than Politics.SE and both would be perfectly acceptable for their communities. 
"One other part to it - the person who is to be called offsides must be involved in the play at the time of the pass.  So if the passer is kicking the ball into the right side corner, a player on the far left side can be closer to the goal than two defenders, and would not technically be offside."
"I dunno, if you provide reasons, it is less subjective.  Also, assuming no other obstructions, right?"
I still see that as bad subjective. It meets five of the six guidelines of good subjective but misses Great subjective questions insist that opinion be backed up with facts and references. Its going to be difficult to find some kind of non-opinion related references.

When I go on a ski trip I usually like to go at least two days in a row. The issue I run into by about midday on the second day is that my legs are pretty much shot.  I would like to be able to do at least two days of fairly intense skiing without getting drained to the point of exhaustion by the end of day two. Are there any exercises I could focus on to help improve my endurance for when I hit the slopes?.
"Technically the play cannot end with two runners on the same base. If two runners are occupying the same base, then the trailing runner is considered In Jeopardy, or able to be tagged out, and must either retreat to the previous base or, if it is occupied, the leading runner must advance a base. However, if the trailing runner was forced to the base then the leading runner is considered In Jeopardy and must advance or be tagged out. "

"Ive often heard that the linebacker is the quarterback for the defense. Thus, is it really true that a linebackers role is sometimes to produce calls to change the defensives game plan or an audible?. Is it possible for the linebackers to call audibles to counter the offenses call?.  "
"I remember in the old days that if a referee caught a team playing zone defense that they would blow the whistle to stop the play and call Illegal Defense. I havent seen this foul called in a very long time so Im not sure if it is because teams have gotten smarter and stopped playing zone or if the rules have been changed. Also, I have noticed what appears to be a newer foul of Defensive Three Seconds where if a defender stands in the lane for 3 seconds then it is a foul giving the opposing team one free throw attempt and the ball back. Is this a replacement rule of some sort? "
"Sorry, I dont have a reference for this, but we studied this in Game Theory: statistically matching the outcome of equal opponents. When you match any two opponents of absolutely equal skill, the contest should end a stalemate (i.e. the rules should not give advantage to one over the other). In baseball, if a hypothetically perfect pitcher could throw every pitch at the  outside  corner of the strike zone, it is very difficult to hit the ball in play. Even the best batter  is at a statistical disadvantage in that perfectly-matched contest. So, they make it so the batter doesnt  have  to hit the ball in bounds to keep the engagement in play &mdash; they need only make contact with the ball to keep from being called out. That good enough to try again rule keeps the competition in better balance without inadvertently giving advantage of one player over the other because of an unbalanced rule.  "
"One thing I would mention is to try to minimize the risk to your environment and yourself. Use whatever control you have to avoid colliding with other people as well as trees, rocks, etc. Try and warn someone if it looks like you may collide. Usually this wont leave enough time to actually react but it may work. I also try to slow myself as much as possible. If you can reasonably get an edge in you may be able to slow yourself completely and almost lay down instead of straight up falling. Its been my experience that falling at high speeds often results in tumbling and multiple impacts which has resulted in some of my worst injuries. "

"When undertaking physical training, as opposed to practice and skills drills, for your chosen sport, how much benefit is there in cross-training?. For example, Im a cyclist, Im preparing for various long distance, quite hilly events. Should I train solely on the bike, what is the benefit in shifting to running, skiing or swimming?. Theres the theory that says train the body to do the thing youre training for, after all you dont get better at the violin by sitting at the piano, but thats skills. If youre training the body to be in the saddle for 6 or 7 hours, with lots of time with the pulse well into the red zone, is doing running for an hour or two still training the right stuff?. Mentally, breaking up the sessions is important as a bit of a rest from the routine, but am I wasting a session?  "

"I have watched many curling matches (games? Im honestly not sure of the terminology) during coverage of the olympics.

Where/how can I better appreciate curling?. "
"Which is harder, running uphill or running downhill?. I have done the Salt Lake City, Utah marathon and it has a huge chunk of descending.  I think circa 5000 feet vertical the route of the year I ran it. I was surprised how much my quads hurt from catching myself on every downhill step. I suppose if you trained for it, it would not be so bad.  
 But which is actually harder?  Uphill or downhill?. "
"Running uphill is harder...if you know how to run downhill effectively. Running downhill requires rapid feet, and shorter than normal strides - specifically so you DONT catch yourself. Think of a 500 pound stone falling towards your head.  You wouldnt try to catch it, instead you should just try to flick it to the side (and slide your body the other way). When running downhill, this is exactly whats happening. A huge stone (the Earth) is coming at you quickly, and you cant stop it. So instead, with a quick foot movement you flick it behind you, and slide your body forward. This takes practice, guts, and more practice!  But, its faster, and MUCH easier than over striding, slamming your heels down, and constantly trying to stop gravity from pulling you down the hill. Dont try this for the first time in a race, especially not a trail race, as you need to learn the footwork to be safe, and to control the inevitable adrenaline rush as you realize youre one misstep away from eating it!!. "
"Running uphill will definitely exhaust you faster if you try to keep a too fast pace. On the other hand, if the hill is not too steep, it doesnt have to be much harder than running on a flat surface. Running downhill really depends on your technique and what conditions are you running in. It will be completely different if the road is wet or otherwise slippery, as you will have to put in a lot more energy to keep your balance. But if the road is dry and you have good shoes, it can be pretty easy with some practice. I have this 1.5km long climb on my regular jogging track, which is quite steep. I live on top of the hill, so at first I have to run down, and at the end of the track run it back up. If Im running it in good weather conditions, I can run down pretty fast, feeling confident that I wont slip and basically dont get tired at all. But if it is a rainy day, I take a huge care with every step, making it almost as exhausting as running back up. The difference with running up is that it is almost always the same, no matter the weather conditions. "
It is much easier to make contact with a pitch on a bunt than with a regular swing. The foul out on a bunt rule basically exists to speed up play and prevent gamesmanship on the part of the batter.  If the batter could always bunt on strike two then batters like the pitcher and other poor hitters would walk significantly more often because it is easier for them to make even a little contact with a decent pitch than it is for the pitcher to continue to throw strikes. 
"How is the average number of strokes decided for each hole?. While watching golf competitions, the majority of players are far below the par.  Shouldnt it then be adapted? If 90% of players are doing an eagle on a Par 5, why isnt it converted to a Par 3?. It should work as long as you dont try to compare from year to year if there has been a change in-between. "

The accepted policy on most of the network is not the answer you cite (why did you choose that particular answer?) but the [answer with very strong support in terms of votes](http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/64068/is-cross-posting-a-question-on-multiple-stack-exchange-sites-permitted-if-the-qu) on the thread that the thread you cite is closed as a duplicate as
Don't beat yourself up over it. It's perfectly acceptable to give a good answer (and reap the rep rewards) from a bad question. Placing it on hold isn't the same as deleting it. The whole point of the &quot;on hold&quot; is that it gives the OP scope to improve it.
 There's certainly always one view... your own... It's probably just coincidence that someone else saw your question immediately after it was posted.
Don't accuse me this time
I'd go with coincidence but I noticed it a while ago and it is pretty consistent.
 I have habit of clicking every question whenever i am here and maybe someone else also clicks instantly
I believe this applies to more than just META. Don't regular posts get a box in the chatrooms as well? That could account for the extra view if they count the chatroom boxing as a view
The One-Box doesn't happen for ten minutes on average. So any edited/updated title or text will be reflected at that time. That doesn't explain immediate double views
 Are you sure? I have seen chat bot posting question on chat in less then a minute
last two appeared 4 minute late in chat to me but i have seen faster ones too i think. But i do agree there time is not fixed.

I think they should be on topic. I understand that chord identification in a music and other questions alike are not. The scores are usually available and this often serves the curiosity of beginners that wish to play some song. Instrument identification is interesting and has broader reach. If one likes music and plays it's normal that he/she likes instruments and everything around their evolution. In this sense it might be interesting to musicians in the community. This is basically a musicology / etno musicology question. The same might be valid to identifying an odd instrument sound in an audio track.
These dots are the same across the network. Sorry. At this time we haven't made these customizable yet. Good catch. Gold badges displayed correctly on the main site
I don't see what would be wrong with supporting both

I believe the general SE policy is that any variant of English is OK and shouldn't be changed due to minor spelling or semantic issues. But if something's confusing to the point that it's a concern
How can I edit my profile biography? It needs some fixing. There are typo errors and I can add a thing or two etc. I was trying to find it myself

I recently came across a question about encountering an error that source files were missing for an Ableton project. What is your opinion about general troubleshooting questions?  My definition for a general troubleshooting question is a question that's more about a common computer error
My opinion is that this is not a place for general troubleshooting questions. They are not music-related and are more questions about general computer use.
I sometimes run into puzzling conflicts in the culture of this site and I wonder if there is a way of clarifying this for me. Is there a way of answering the question of how many anonymous members are self-identified music professionals 
There is no way of doing this - by their very nature
I'm just wondering and this is not anything particular to this site but is it really a good thing for a site's mod to not have the personal details part of his user page filled in? Should we not know something about the people who are given the responsibility of being moderators? I don't really see how you can be anonymous and a mod.
I'm not a mod
It should be clear in the answers people give what the amount of experience and skill they possess. Also the amount of money that a teacher gets paid is not all that descriptive of the skills they possess.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I personally know of a few teacher that began teaching when they where 16 and a few also that did tutor work when they where at college before they even graduated. If all it takes to be a professional is to get paid than all of these people would be professionals as well.
Why is the lowest note on the piano an A? It's wrong. But wrong answers are answers
I would say that that answer is more of a comment rather than an answer. It's not that it's wrong 
The OP knows what a clef is and knows two of them and can at least try and look up information about different clefs. If someone brought us a picture of a clef and didn't know what it was it would be rather hard for them to research on their own and maybe they even tired and failed.
But the tooltip says exactly that it  does not show any research effort
It doesn't close the door through voting specifically
Demanded was bad wording from my side
Then shouldn't the question you're asking be the opposite (as they are currently off-topic defined by the FAQ)? If you want the site to reevaluate it's stance on requesting  a list of resources then address that rather then trying to say  This question is closed
Dom I am not putting forward a view on whether or not such questions should be on topic. The issue is *consistency*.
Not every question is reviewed by every person
Matthew Read Two others are mentioned in the comments. Not every question is reviewed by every person  doesn't explain three close votes for the one that is on hold
There's nothing from stopping you from explaining why something is off-topic to a new user.  Every close reason links to the help center which links to the on-topic/off-topic section. If the question is off-topic
They are not synonyms but they are not separate. A piano and a harpsichord both have keyboards
Synthesis (????????) in Greek means composition.
but the question isn't about the manuscript - it's about locating something rare and special... I would agree with you that playing from a manuscript is different from modern notation (in the distant past I was a first violin... so I vaguely remember)
i disagree that this aligns with 'recommendations of pieces' because the ballroom aspect makes it less of an opinion
NotAuto just make a new question like I said. It's not really helpful to the OP if you completely rewrite his question just so it better fits in with our site.
I'm not sure. The lilypond has over 5x the number of views. Maybe the community does prefer lilypond
Dom But did we find a renderer? If I'm not mistaken the devs asked us for one
I am one of those who closed the question and therefore I feel I can't deny the responsibility to speak for why I closed the question. Maybe I haven't seen Breaking Bad
John Smith Optional is asking for examples of classic Western influences in Breaking Bad in support of the creator's statement that such influences exist. This is a far more interesting question than most that are asked on this site. It references a series that is highly popular and might bring fans to the site. It may not have one perfect right answer
For sure it is not a opinion based question and its answer should be fact based not opinion based. I am not in favor of closing this question and &lt;strong&gt;specially the closing reason is completely wrong&lt;/strong&gt;. The existing answer presented by @Flyk is also not a opinion based at all and based on fact. So i think it should be reopened and i have even posted my reopen vote too. 
Changing the English title is a bit risky. O.K.

This question was closed rightfully so.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The author claims that they look for a &quot;game-theoretical explanation&quot;.

Theoretical questions are not too broad or opinion-based.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is not the theoretical nature of your question that makes it broad.  It's the open-endedness of it.  ;There could be many reasons why Authoritarian governments last as long as they do

AlexanderO'Mara  The distinguishing factor is that the author of an answer should be able to provide something other than his/her personal opinion.  If you're asking about the opinion of some notable person or some notable demographic
AlexanderO'Mara  I'm not entirely sure.  The other SE I'm active in is StackOverflow
I'm not sure about the definition of who's opinion on these more-subjective SE sites
AlexanderO'Mara Just because an answer is about an opinion doesn't mean that the answer is an opinion.   A notable feature of cases like these

I'm having this problem
;Although I can't verify this
"PeterDeWeese sorry, misread the question. Still a medical question. You might look into the type of filtration your local pool uses. Some filters are better at dealing with bacteria than others (DE filters are better than sand or cartridge filters)...Doesnt help with open water, but its something."
"TonnyMadsen this question isnt constructive because it ask for a product recommendation. Its a shopping question, not because it has to do with running."
"Unfortunately, swim teams dont typically have control over the pool facility."
"PeterDeWeese no, but if you are having constant infection issues then you might be able to affect change at your facility by making a complaint, or switching facilities (you likely arent the only ones)."
+1 for the last paragraph. Sometimes if something is wrong it might not be apparent right away (and sometimes it will be VERY apparent lol).
Would you mind linking to the chlorine information you found? Its not directly related to the answer but it sounds like it might be worth reading into for people having the same problem.
"I have extremely flat feet, to the point that any arch in a shoe is painful. There is no orthotic or other insert that has an arch that helps because my foot is completely flat; arches actually give me pain. I have no back pain or other problems whatsoever from having flat feet my whole life (from birth, in other words). So, Ive noticed when buying ice hockey skates that they all have arches basically molded into the boot and after about ten minutes of skating, my feet just plain ache. If I skate or play for an hour or more, I have such extreme pain that my I cant stand for about 15 minutes. I recently purchased a wide skate that appears to have very little arch support (yea!) but they still give me aching pain after about 30 minutes. Is there any ice skate or advice for a person such as myself with extremely flat feet? "
"I havent used the interval setting on a treadmill so I cant answer to that. However, Ive usually found that running once around a track (400m or 1/4 mile) hard, walking 1 1/4 (100m) around the track and continuing that process for x miles to be a success. So, Id probably recommend increasing your run times and run speed. You may find in doing so that you need to decrease your jog speed. Im not sure that there is a scientific answer to this problem and if you ask 10-20 great runners, youll probably get 5-10 varying opinions. "
"I know I can set a treadmill at the quick start setting and just run. But, why cant I set a program or the manual setting (which calculates calories burned) to longer than 60 minutes? "
"This is a serious athletic training issue that affects me and certain of my athletes: some swimmers are prone to ENT and respiratory infections such as in the ear, sinuses, throat and lungs.  Last year I only had 7 weeks to train before a 4.4mi open water swim because of pneumonia.  Given that even treated pool water can be a vector for bacteria, what can a swimmer do to help prevent infections?."
"In the past several years the sacrifice bunt has come under fire as a waste of an at bat and lowering your chance to score. No one denies that outs are very valuable in baseball, but is it ever a good idea to intentionally give up an out to advance a runner (or runners)?. I am more interested in cases where the pitcher is not at bat.    "
"From what I understand, there are 2 benefits to toe strap bindings: It helps you push the heel of your foot further back into the bindings. Theres less added pressure on the top of your toe, so more comfort. I have Burton Citizen bindings and my sister has a Burton Stilleto.  I can tell you point 2 is definitely true. Our indoor snow area use T-Bars and what I found is that in my normal board, by the time I get to the top, the pinky toe on my left foot (I ride regular) goes numb because of the added pressure by pushing the board forward going uphill.  At first I thought it was because I ride 18 degrees forward, but I changed it to 15, and I still get the same issue.  However when I try out her board, I never get the numbness.  This is only in T-Bar situations though. I would also assume that toe straps are quicker response wise when you go back edge as the first thing to react would be your toes, though Im no pro, so its just speculation on my end. Hope this helps. "
"The oil is used to increase the grip or tackiness of the rubber surface of the racquet. You can actually just use ordinary oils (like sunflower oil) but the oils vendors sell are manufactured for the specific purpose of applying to table tennis rubber. Anyway, you want to use a medium width brush (like something youd use to paint model airplanes or something like that) to apply a coat of the oil evenly on to the rubber, then let it soak into the rubber (can take anywhere from 20 minutes to a few hours depending on the rubber). Then repeat this process (applying the oil and letting it soak in) 2-3 times. Advanced players need very tacky rubber to impart the type of spin on the ball that they want as well as to deal with the spins put on the ball by their opponents shots. Really tacky rubber on a racquet should allow you to pick a ball up off the table using just the rubber surface. "
"Ive played with 1, 2 and 3 star balls. Im not sure 4 or 5 star exist. Some companies have brands that they say are 4-star but they arent actually rated above 3-star because a 3 star rating means the highest quality ball possible. The factors that go into the rating are durability, visibility of the seam on the ball, balance of the ball and elasticity. The legal colors to play with are white and orange, though you can find all kinds of different colors in most sporting goods stores. Typically 1 or 2 star balls are bought in bulk (packs of 100 or 200) and used for rallying or practice - and the 3 star balls are saved for real competition (matches). Youll notice that after ping pong balls see some action, they slowly lose some of the smooth matte finish when they are new out of the package. "
"If you feel that you are falling I believe the best you can do is to tuck to avoid injuring your wrists/elbows and avoid hitting the slope with your head. In certain situations falling can be avoided, but I dont know any techniques for that - it comes naturally with your experience, I believe. After the fall I do try to turn to my back - but I dont lift the board - quite the contrary, I try to come to full stop as quickly as possible. When you fall its sometimes possible to quickly get back to your feet if you havent lost momentum - but Im pretty sure its best to take your time and listen to your sensations to avoid worsing your injuries - I once broke a wrist and it took me good 10 minutes to realise something was wrong with it. And btw, getting twisted ankle on snowdoard is kind of tricky unless one of your feet gets unstrapped. "
When playing in a 4-5-1 or 4-4-3 formation you are meant to stay in your zone on the pitch. The defenders need to be part of the back 4 and not move into the forward postions. How then do defenders get out of position and actually score goals ? Given that goals are encouraged (obviously) but isnt being out of position a bad thing from the managers point of view?. 
"Im a less experienced runner, training for a half marathon. Up until now I only ran a maximum of 10 miles and I never felt the need to hydrate, but I read its better to hydrate during the run. What should I use for hydration, just water? I read that energy drinks dont make a lot of sense during a run, and are better to drink after the run, or not at all. And how would I carry it? Ive seen belts and hydration packs, but they dont seem comfortable.  "
When I go on a ski trip I usually like to go at least two days in a row. The issue I run into by about midday on the second day is that my legs are usually shot. I would like to be able to do at least two days of fairly intense skiing.
When I go on a ski trip I usually like to go at least two days in a row. The issue I run into by about midday on the second day is that my legs are pretty much shot.  I would like to be able to do at least two days of fairly intense skiing without getting drained to the point of exhaustion by the end of day two. Are there any exercises I could focus on to help improve my endurance for when I hit the slopes?.
"Technically the play cannot end with two runners on the same base. If two runners are occupying the same base, then the trailing runner is considered In Jeopardy, or able to be tagged out, and must either retreat to the previous base or, if it is occupied, the leading runner must advance a base. However, if the trailing runner was forced to the base then the leading runner is considered In Jeopardy and must advance or be tagged out. "
