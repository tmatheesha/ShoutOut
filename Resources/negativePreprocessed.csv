im positive as uses nondeterministic garbage collection which means unreferenced memory freed whenever runtime feels like typically unless theres reason run since expensive operation execute this approach used modern garbage collected languages like c java well assuming references memory pointed bytearray  items within array memory freed point exit scope bytearray  declared you force garbage collection though really shouldnt if testing production youll hurt performance much help to force gc try yes twice flashsystemsystemgc flashsystemsystemgc
unfortunately comes memory management flashactionscript  isnt whole lot actionscript designed easy use didnt want people worry memory management the following workaround instead creating bytearray  variable try var byteobjectobject  new object byteobjectbytearray  new bytearray then finished delete variable byteobject delete byteobjectbytearray where  bytearray  dynamic property byteobject  free memory allocated

the concern meta tags loosely defined tags cannot stand using definition could argued would likely need something taguk tagparliament
i agree better question would localized going allow go we probably dont want anyone trying create tag moose jaw saskatchewan politics
as i one asking question linked i believe allow leeway facts gathered even opinionated questions watch questions answered facts opinions
can expand bit campaign advice might for example free supporter management software q might bit shady do i need complex campaign bureaucracy run city council one might 
the solution avoid flame wars everyone state answers neutral fashion ie dont bring question talking democrats republicans question doesnt ask if someone posts unnecessarily partisan response downvote 
 jrg ive expanded bit original answer hopefully bit clearer though im entirely clear specifics i wont surprised isnt
i dont disagree do think questions i linked didnt really work history example
yannisrizos its much theres reason include reason exclude political history questions generally answerable allowing increases scope site manageable amount
does anyone attempt tag united mexican states us internet im pretty sure answer 
im much interesting questions constructiveness opinion whether offtopic way fracking question i suppose politics courses may cover economics unlikely cover fracking  could valid reason making distinction economics fields
casebash sorry i got little ahead the question could speak policy tightly coupled economics across board i dont think separate two once edits question i think would better example discussion a purely economic related question like  social security go bankrupt would would proposed policy  cause social security go bankrupt might topic i think context king deciding type question
these two different entities europe eu for tags correct
 casebash thats kind point i cant say yes title least point it would depend entirely meat question however im leaning fracking one i cant piece together hypothetical question along lines would fit the immigration one depends meat bill would make change thats im saying  context king point
i kinda like skeptics i wont pretend didnt take i felt confident enough ask question 
 yannisrizos that exactly concern barrier entry high community  when barrier entry high people matter moderators major players clique forms  the absolute death site would people afraid ask questions provide answers clique starts forming
i dont think theres clique skeptics i might confident asking first question quite well received i get dont want set bar high time naturally controversial subject like politics unmanageable set bar low in case theres urgency still private beta discussion probably carry i think lot easier come balanced policy get public beta get better idea questions site attracts
in case maybe target proper political name countries especially present political history ontopic historically speaking united states purely represent ones america  
i agree requirements skeptics high you example even allowed use basic logic argue prove something you reliable source says say i dont think need requirement 
on  question political aspects islam popularity tactics islamism political movement opposed many experience muslims i tried correct misahepprehension distinction response comment mention on  i still dont see narrow question except absurdly artificial manner i would appreciate advice sensibly rather suggestions whether your proposed title may interesting question one i intended ask
 gerrit doesnt exclude groups because even direct power law strive mightily influence people 
i disagree i might want subscribe karl marx maybe even al gore why 
not move original questions discussion name anything tried effective i think answer so facts limits us listing things dont work not terribly useful discussion im saying site change policy im saying eliminates i think really interesting questions another example would happen eliminated electoral college  would happen we dont know campaigns would significantly change experiment see effective
kevinpeno chat indeed already running hopefully become far active private beta i meant 
i understand but strict qa format workable politics the interesting questions politics tend items dont clear answer
you dont really accept answer
brockadams sorry i think wording item  may helped ive clarified meant basically item  comment different location
votes views constitute good questions
toscho i dont think really fair describe advantagesdisadvantages type question shopping list question specific context politicsse  phraseology may poor really attempt ask might someone argue x legitimate site imo cautious appear incite debate
whether listtype questions i dont know i also think questions advantagesdisadvantages suitable questions one may objectively research arguments commonly cited example climate change skepticismtherefore i think fine
my point answer there way avoid opinions questions this isnt hypothetical i see every day sites
i agree  judge people actions rather beliefs on political leaning private  general id agree society positions carry extra burdens ensure privileges also carry arent abused often service transparency government judges example usually expected disclose potential conflicts interest necessary recuse 
on guessing users preferences fun isnt one method helps attempt write good questions try make impossible reader guess opinion matter not sure successful i ive blown coever question anyway
it additional background information readers answer
 zero need see

i think allow questions campaigning for questions opaquely seeking campaign advice probably worry question localized i think many campaign advice questions caught normal rules se website i think main thing lookout questions seeking campaign advice i question of course exact wording would rare cant difficult identify questions saying much different words politicsse aim descriptive rather prescriptive questions call exact opposite im bit hesitant give strict list criterion i dont want overcorrect asofyet nonexistent problem i havent really participated much meta given se site im really sure communities normally deal sorts issues

i dont think practical restrict questions government bodies apart anything else would define government body would include example palestinian national authority what hezbollah runs hospitals schools certainly lay claim monopoly violence areas the restriction would also make difficult impossible raise questions important political organisations like suffragettes campaign nuclear disarmament movimiento sin tierra obviously within scope qampa site politics 
if nothing tried worked know best way questions arent  factoriented arent necessarily bad able look list answers say ones probably right i could post answer i think requiring donations multiples would decrease corruption theres nothing makes answer right wrong a better way interpret question might what methods tried reduce corruption comes fundraising how much success now asking stuff thats actually tried whatever random untested theory reader happens come top head

the problem duplicate questions across sites dilutes expertise  one core goals so model single authoritative place find expertquality answers by duplicate questions across sites core goal undermined
if se model wanted single authoritative place wouldnt many se sites  i find hard believe type overlap hasnt already dealt it sets bad precedent even searched site question might asked another se site still get closed  it also means spend day night linking existing questions im sure better things 
unsigned if two questions didnt already exist scifi i would probably agree iow two questions may well ontopic although scifi community believes theyre topic argue but since questions already exist elsewhere disservice everyone identical questions two places
we need involve scifise discussion public beta i dont believe anyone without account view meta discussion maybe still worth asking scifi meta question anyway
the reason many se sites different areas expertise create duplicate content and yes issue dealt understanding official stand basically covered answer question
after  months tags single instances clipped this great gets rid useless tags harmful leaves question without tags results taguntagged
movingclosing question cause bad user experience in fact opposite having multiple duplicate questions causes bad user experience closing duplicate merging improve user experience multiple gateways set answers
exactly though plot fits fits scifi i think opposed report regarding example question real golden questions ones fit experts directing acting performancesi think movies really people and scenario effects else would breadandbutter just opinion though
theyre considered movies is difference movie film id definitely consider filmfor anything natural medium big screen
never noticed anyways clarified faq also made clear boundaries i saw many questions could answered link different sesites so i think somewhat unclear
i dont challenge close but i think rules clear
and bug listings outdate real quick and probably isnt much interesting question anyway anyone besides developer doesnt know well would like complete assessment bugs
right next powers probably second biggest force could influence mergethat dont frown upon overlaps moreso decide encourage tv highproduction series think hbo
bugs mistake question easter eggs
fair enough i cant see way ordinary members edit faq
refer lit science fiction sites see dealt seeing sites nontechnical would best see happened dont assume every person knows subjective questions frowned upon also  sir
the character limit tags i believe  acousticbassguitar isnt specific question strictly electric bass
its  i thought bad also still means i counted wrong
my bad i blame gamingse confusion
chriss im saying audio shouldnt merged shouldnt merged us  i agree stats good  theyll improve avp site
lennart im sure i understand  if audiences music avp sites dont overlap isnt reason keep separate  and i dont think recording techniques overlap much playing techniques besides obvious things like muddied playing wont result clear recording
also ponder use tags when question recording guitar tags enter well recording guitar course this means site filtering recording questions easy but av site would also enter tag music every musical question tag doesnt come natural asking question recording guitar questions recording music therefore hard find follow av site
lennart oh  i wouldnt put absolutely i agree music recording music overlap music recording video production  but avp video  it cover audio recording music recording subset i believe audience musicless audio recording overlaps audience music recording strongly much music performancepracticetheory overlaps music recording
lennart i dont see music tag would necessary  in rare cases guitars recorded completely nonmusical purposes specified question  music would default assumption
matthew how people like interested recording music find question isnt tagged site questions completely different things
but this question home somewhere se network home 
hmm  interesting i didnt think way  i forced upvote p
lennart it equal time  this isnt likely resolved soon since looks like powers want start avp soon see pans 
as beginner i find really even able ask answer expert questions i dont know enough theory composition subjects lend deeper analysis im worried i wont able contribute well beta 
 using software synths topic audiose sort question would topic 
im super confident answer please feel free improve 
what mean reverse engineering  transcribing
i also dont think would issue way specific  questions closed too localized this question would relevant small geographic area specific moment time extraordinarily narrow situation generally applicable worldwide audience internet  i think last part applies 
im sure theres lot worldwide figures music specific question could well widely wanted nugget knowledge just throw thought 
matthew occurred also specific example i used last paragraphs asking closed too localised so i agree probably disallow questions limited interest unless something like 
audio recording merged site added site scope
it worth trying a possible trajectory experts find beginner questions interesting answer start asking i guy created original proposal i expert
first i disagree slightly site solely making music  while title certainly covers making music theory explicitly ontopic inform practice performance  while degree history also informs practice performance  it also influence composition ontopic
why extra word music it obviously music 
i think give help transcribing particular songs certainly host transcriptions  i think help particular song specific useful site could definitely run legal issues on hand help transcription general ontopic  i think question playing ear would ontopic clear difference write notes learned play ear  you still get specifics eghow i transcribe guitar masked lots cymbals without naming song  it probably good help people learn general transcription skills well rather come back help every song
there aspects reverseengineering piece i understand transcribing apply old recent compositions without scoreltunderstandingcommenting harmony themes form composition techniques inspiration sources related worksin opinion perfectly acceptable long making short quotations works still copyright i believe classical works important part music practice performance alas like willie wong suggested many questions could viewed localizeddiscussion arrangement ornementation bass figuration instrumentation orchestration used recording particular form work different available sources
i personally fan community wiki questions count towards experience sharepoint beta wikied answers count towards fulfilling area committments there probably badges counting things count well suspicion electorate similar
i think requirement question source contemporary composers innovative nature subjective argumentative list would subjective create fierce flamewars hence impossible objectively answer question questions type open ended usually lead confrontation argument if question asked source new contemporary composers person decide composer innovative listening question would fine but requiring judge composers innovative question becomes impossible therefore closed
care repair definitely ontopic  it closely related musical performance drawing line would useful i sure instrument construction  while certainly large overlap i would assume majority relevant questions irrelevant average musician  that said i would problem site host unless musical instrument construction maintenance repair proposal takes if would presumably migrate care  repair questions well
this may moot point guitarsse merge could happening really soon i seen couple duplicate questions already answered guitars musicse already is acceptable simply redirect user already answered question how handle scenario
viola violin close enough instruments considered discussions  technically violinfamily accurate tag i think former inevitably going fall use simply unwieldy term case point currently  questions tagged tagged violinfamily there also tag i tried start one earlier i enough points likely become neglectedwhat i forgot mention reason i bring viola questions regarding viola answered violinists lot violinists likely see questions tagged in sense general term like violinfamily could better
the vast majority copyright infringement goes unchallenged  the fact illegal mean people whether internet you heard torrent sites yes this mention depends specific area  it might illegal someone one country post transcription might illegal someone elsewhere if want definitively answered going hire lot lawyers  if like look piece related law see i tell circumstances would grant transcription rights 
i think need rock n roll the questions far often theoretical awesome take wrong but questions serious students music target audience much smaller get questions wannabe rock stars and wannabe rock stars benefit questions musical theory well winwin situation unfortunately i searched inner teenage rockstar wannabe buried incompetence long ago i forgot questions 
after days public beta  committers signed followers signed commitments fulfilled these good signs less good signs numbers new questions bit slow questions leaning lot toward basic questions single wikipedia google search could solve almost instantly  committers committed proposal would expect dedication activity committers   followers account almost  current users so time discuss ways promoting site make grow dynamic
i still think problem site called quotmusical practice performance i came site via area  music theory merged but someone coming site hearing might realize suitability music theory might turn experts area
i think similar homework questions stack overflow  asker puts littletono effort question helpful way getting people grunt work that said someone made substantial effort needs little help ex analyzing chords song needing help one two i think fine especially people answering provide helpful tips asker could figure alone
 i asked question ago bounty expired i sort forgot i see one answer awarded bounty i think i award anyhow anyway award bounty answer particularly helpful
i seen closings i consider validsuch couple shopping questions i think moderators become little ambitious towards closing guitars   se questions attempt quotavoid problems guitars first i really sure means elaboration would nicebut particular   enforce driving logic behind closing questions like one linked questions related specifics gear   guitar electronics amp design effects design pedalboard design ad nauseum closed well i could argue circuit design stratocaster electrical   engineering consequently belongs physicsse etcetera the distinction subject matter inside broader topic best handled tags closings it happens circuit design good bit emag heavily utilized subject matter designing describing amplifiers electric guitars guitar effects  it cross cutting aspect opinion much belongs hereevery bit much questions related repair general maintenance technique
i expect would suppress site longer exists
 there eventually open moderator elections i sure guitarsse users i also know merge held protemp moderators  musicse appointed i sure time frame open elections going significantly far perhaps wisdom appointing transitional mod chernoff chime one
i see provided indicate sources already searched save everyone time including 
tags created independent questions  if set good ontopic questions music videos tag added
i sure way phrase question want ontopic still get answer want it sounds like want openended list things almost always going scope se sitei suspect things want could found tv tropes site maybe start tropes list bourne series go to clear i absolutely saying willing help figure questions ontopic ask one likely get answer but question probably going exactly one mind came the fact asking help phrasing question means recognize core offtopic way fix change questionthat new question may well interesting useful right true strongly encouraged ask just aware  probably going get answers originally looking 
for something year i playing guitar alternate tuning i invented found unable get anywhere using conventional tuning since fingers would always brush strings supposed unlike quotnovice tuningsquot eg allow major chords played easily make minor chords impossible require tenfret shifts going certain chords tuning allows major minor seventh chords played easily within reasonable range first nine frets first finger confined first sixif anyone written discussed tuning i like read hence question has anyone encountered gddfgb tuning guitarwhich i hope ontopic written  if nobody ever written tuning i curious appropriate way would solicit opinions i wish overly vain fact novice could hours go able play anything able play mermaid song lloyd weber amazed lonestar would suggest tuning offer unique advantages many people may find useful
i would like ask related question i still trying learn appropriate place followup question to ask new question would somewhat redundant to add comment really question to add answer really answering although best answers life often better question another long discussion i avoid ok saidi previously voiced support meta scope currently stands makes musicse unique asisi love community part limit scope regards genre bringing contact folks happen make music but since clear deliberations site regards genre bring one little hiccup regarding lyrics lyrics greatly important performancerelated issue classical artists make art recreating composer songs this also falls genres known singing covers focusing moment classical music specific musical performance choices hinge key insights text interpretation make questions domain keep scope clear consistent site attracts members
i think need add something asking resources list topic flag reasons it uncommon see questions asking drumless tracks good sound editor 
any tweak like going take development effort stackexchange shown indication solving jtab problems get betaposts already suggested elegant solutionsi note single line monospace examples also use backticks at point i believe turning jtab entirely would good idea  lots content relies upon every instance applied incorrectly one workarounds place it sucks learning curve code blocks new users   thing keeping us graduating
we lot sites throughout history stack exchange suffered problems dealing recommendation questions that questions intending gather collection recommended items author selects preferred answer here would questions like following i enjoyed  lucky number slevin  movies like i enjoy are good steampunk movies however kinds questions poor performance sites this functionality conflicts intent sites our goal expert solutions identified depth knowledge users the accepted answer system founded principle answer serves understood closure  question quick notes  to summarize conciselythey require extensive maintenance never happens long accurate the voting lists conflicts scope voting site people vote poll based quality  no single item list conclude  question conflicts nature qampa many problems result trying reduce scope due subjectivity narrow criteria so allowed generally allowed compounding ease spread itemized list recommendations gives poor image site showcase expertise many looking fornow moment necessarily intent invite allow recommendation questions recommendations fact noted offtopic definition phase trace top voted ontopic questions nevertheless i writing hopefully get people mindset understand recommendations hazardous consequently help setup norec policy site  opens public beta 
what would point movie qna ask questions plot movie
i think take case case basis good rule thumb ok tag series movies i see inception good tag movie generates lot discussions would really want snakes plane tag 
doesn pretty much preclude questions scifi movies asked moviesse almost every question scifi movie nature science fiction is star wars movie  yes  let post moviesseoh wait also scifi related maybe i post scifise instead the average person going agonize decision going post wrong site lousy user experience find question movedclosed battle going whether posted right place ditto literaturese  scifise  questions scifi books appropriate places  what superuser  askubuntuapplese  pretty much anything askubuntu appropriate superuser well mac questions applese it security  serverfault statistical analysis  mathematics theoretical physics  physics major potential overlap created stackexchange expanding going get worse  if questions appropriate multiple sites asking needs facilitated my solution why create kind association overlapping sites questions similar titles appear title question entered expanded search sites overlap  this way anyone tries ask question scifise may already exist moviesse literaturese appear results hopefully prevent duplicate asked edit  they appear general search results 
i think although always ambiguity major distinction made community expert se caters moviesse making movie casting effects production script scenes scifise universes fantasy science fiction lore reasons behind things ie nerdy stuff obviously especially movie comes book plotstoryline characters real major overlap ontopic sites 
my question what done postproduction  got criticized showing reasearch effort general reference although may valid i find reference rule i remember ever encounter sesites so i think questions ruled faq state clearly clear questions qualify 
 can i ask questions bollywood indian movies private beta or inappropriate private beta users 
the problem i see site becomes popular goal might situation stackoverflow end needing split multiple sites anyway 
i would say ontopic  it question businessmodels marketing strategy product management technology  little content movies technology impact movies  resolutions go new technologies like d digital filming starts impact design movies ontopic  cost disks 
i think relaxation repcap really needed at start beta enough mods looking site time users build reputation gain rights the relaxation needed reputation gain privilieges helps active participants gain privileges site beta so midst beta mods start look different sites at end beta including open beta enough users reached k k 
probably given option spoiler checkbox clicked let framework append spoiler question plus wise reveal plot give away ending question that made sensitive forum going lot movie watchers googlers future 
the proposal marked statusdeclined simply site launched merge happen now whether happenhellip i leave experts chime closing area  discussion brings discussion theoretical proposal  forum actual users charged responsibility building  site discuss but i would like dispel two  weak  reasons consider merger merge tv never launch  that never good reason either complementary audience combining sites prop numbers never done the audiences complement others  interests never get network effects  need reach critical mass subject where tv theatrical releases go  i buying one either tv one source story lines movies i sure discuss one context without worrying much crossover if inseparable site include comic books plays short stories books news events history poetry standup comedians 
one purpose reputation cap keeping user earning undue  amount reputation single popular contribution it throttling mechanism keep balance ongoing contribution popularity if anything  reputation cap needed  private beta  there far fewer post everyone concentrating voting little vote so certainly undue least disproportionate  amount rep doled private beta
it would nearly impossible keep scope se sites mutually exclusive scifi literature clearly sites overlap us this issue seen across se partially comes personal preference you might feel comfortable one site another  scifi established site great community followers undoubtedly going questions would also suitable site happiest posting you might also prefer perspective movie goer scifi addict would choose one site another for instance probably going get responses scifi question underlying scifi themes ideas links book movie adapted though also often covered here perspective going movie even prior media books comics it generally discouraged migrate questions sites purely try get subjective best site if ontopic site generally left the scifi mods aware us migrate questions clearly would better handled lack scifi content question 
i would agree unregistered user visited site month question unanswered  requests detail made via comments ignored
one needs answer  what different would warrant exclusion  my answer nothing  if feels like dirtying site many anyways mention i know worth mentioning faq though 
i would say long professionally produced made difference tv web series movies site it likely borders television internet blur upcoming years eventually probably become impossible exclude web stuff anyway the threshold originality professionality important way distribution ask we make sure end getting questions every youtube videblog theretldr allow long produced amateur level  
while badges unobtainable definitely harder beta site due reduced traffic compared graduated site i assume reduced badge constraints want make easy  get badge like  legendary  sort the purpose behind badges way encourage users stick around contribute site 
the badges set every site  for consistancy allow badges roughly meaning across network value sites  it make sense consistancy wise allow beta sites get gold badges site around lot longer it also logistical nightmare  let say lower bar gold badges beta site  what happens ifwhen site graduates  do gold badges lose do keep again easier one standard network wide 
i believe merit keeping identification questions community need consistant enforement quality questions  we need come set rules identification questions required meet for example perhaps shoudd able answer what when where how examples could answered what scifi horror movie space when mid  where united states how movie threatre new release i oversimplifying i believe able extract text identification question answers questions  wihtout answers simple questions lot harder figure person talking 
i think great questions theory someone might interview writer producer show addresses things  getting past initial impression triviality question sound reason take face valuethat said i already exercised right user downvote one i thought unlikely great question  unfortunately  people disagree 
i initially said ok migration i thought would bring interesting speculation well trial children shows sites  granted best examples i think terrible while appear somewhat  jokey  i honestly think terrible questions i think deserve fully closed downvoted i see just 
i know topic week discussed what i suggesting even reward start topic week generate questions site beta i also think general topic generate questions such classic tv sitcoms would generate questions sanford amp son so go ahead start topic week   
i think long build list topics long enough confident idea die i think would good idea if question gets enough support could open another communitywiki question collate order list topics i think people upvote  downvote question register support also people points make answers would also welcome 
"the question bit vague could answered presumably whole slew techniques  i much problem what techniques use make someone thinner muscular bigger etc i see useful question 
 i see category general reference material trivially found actor movie imdb wikipedia i struggled stunt question particularly how decided whether use stunt scene are official rules to initial reading seemed rather non question  script calls dangerous thing performed  automatically stunt other questions like cropped rule seems little naive however reading answer i reappraised question perhaps asking decide sort stunts performed performs much cgi used instead mitigate cost danger  the question could editing clarify point perhaps so sum i think closable perhaps people willing use downvotes suggest edits think good questions "
i remember old review section close bottom let know badge status new review section seems gone only thing i suggest user information click activity swap revisions tab tells many total revisions including tag edits
in opinion bollywood part indianmovies  i think  indianmovies  master tag bollywood  synonym similarly  kollywood  synonym indianmovies  at current   indianmovies  synonym bollywood  wrong reversed but community discussion needed not bollywood tollywood  sandalwood india there many regional languages many movie industries 
 i see point tag synonyms i see bond jamesbond nolan christophernolan wouldn make sense mod approve tags we even people enough rep retagging just thought  
on site small could  moderator approve tags  it would require coordination governing tagging  scheme  moderators beta site  this would start break number people grew moderators people enough reputation on larger site like stackoverflow superuser many moderators coordination would unwieldy i could see breaking downthe tagging mechanism whilst ideal way dealing tagging without significant coordination people unfortunately share platform sites significantly larger 
it current practice tag films independently if enter tags area search strings  see examples films released way generally films star wars harry potter franchises distinctive titles synonyms best way 
most tags questions site contain titles moviesseries without imdb links wouldn useful visitors imdb link visit in opinion would enrich look feel site add clarity questions especially remakes older movies please note i trying promote imdb might well use extensive database 
i netflix like what tv tonight there nothing wrong either questions ephemeral forum maybe stackexchange wants but carrying technical side makes stackoverflow useful someone else far future google similar question find answer so is raining today fit questions  imdb i think usefuli gonna come yeah let  em sidebut really belong meta i use imdb time look stuff movies quirks tricks questions movies  finding movies  learning movies  very meta netflix i think meta value it awful finding movies 
on one side especially scifi futuristic equipment explained handwavium unobtainium scripts completely ignoring realism authors research anything prefering inaccurate cool gizmos in cases seems lost time answer equipment questions things exist work on hand many situations movies must portrait equipment details realistically hold suspension disbelief or author wanted make realistic movie or genre demands portrait use equipment gadgetry heist movies some films also nod fields know presented equipment means inscrutable peopleis allowed ask realistically portrayed things used examplesi saw movie breached safe strange glowing rod what answer it thermic lance in movie attempted drive rich woman crazy gaslighting but translucent woman was really getting crazy end answer no abusers used stage technique named pepper ghost
